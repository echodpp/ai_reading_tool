Reputational Sanctions as A Self-regulatory Tool of China’s Stock Exchanges: Recent Developments of the Law and Practice,"This paper thus aims to examine more recent uses of public criticisms by China's two well-established exchanges (namely the SHSE and the SZSE) during the period of 2013 to 2018,17 and based on such examination, draw implications for the debate on the strategy of employing self-regulation of the stock exchanges in the development of China's capital markets. In so doing, the paper will discuss broader issues concerning the role of reputational sanctions in the enforcement of corporate and securities law, the relationship between stock exchanges and the government regulator, as well as the competition between the stock exchanges.",Dataset analysis & interviewing,"SHSE & SZSE websites, CSMAR","This paper focuses on an important yet understudied form of reputational sanctions in the securities market, namely public criticisms imposed by China's stock exchanges over recent years. This serves as a case study to illustrate the regulatory style and rigor of the Chinese stock exchanges, shedding light on broader issues such as the role of reputational sanctions in the enforcement of corporate and securities law, and the strategy of self-regulation of the stock exchanges in the development of China's capital markets."
STABILITY JUSTICE: PETITIONERS VERSUS NON-PETITIONERS IN CHINA'S CRIMINAL ADJUDICATION,"Different from “judicial repression,” stability justice targets ordinary individuals under the guise of formal judicial procedures, to maintain both social stability and governance legitimacy. Drawing on published judgments and the authors' interviews with judges and prosecutors in China, we find that, in conjunction with the gradual abandonment of traditional violent repression strategies, stability justice has been employed as an alternative tool for managing petitioning activities at the local level. Through the covertly biased application of legal rules and procedural norms, petitioners accused of threatening social stability receive longer terms of pre-trial detention, higher rates of detention before politically sensitive periods, longer custodial sentences, and fewer opportunities for probation. Our findings add new fuel to studies on comparative judicial politics and shed light on judicial behavior in contemporary China.",Dataset analysis (regression),China Judgments Online,"This article studies the mechanism of stability justice by analyzing cases arising from accusations of picking quarrels and provoking trouble against petitioner defendants and non-petitioner defendants. Drawing on statistical analyses of published judicial documents, we provide evidence that, while accusations of picking quarrels and provoking trouble follow formal legal procedures and comply with the law, they may serve stability maintenance purposes by creating both procedural and distributive biases. On the procedural aspects, petitioner defendants may receive longer periods of pre-trial detention than other defendants. Petitioners are also more likely to be detained during politically sensitive periods, when local authorities have a stronger motivation to repress petitioning. On the distributive aspects, petitioner defendants may be sentenced to significantly longer custodial sentences and granted fewer opportunities for probation than non-petitioners, with other conditions held constant. The purpose is to take action against “trouble-makers,” to prevent petitioning activities, and to deter potential petitioners. With the deliberate implementation of all the biases, seemingly justified processes are sometimes turned into a tool for containing petitioners and deterring petitioning strategies."
THE JUDGE AS A NEGOTIATOR: CLAIMS NEGOTIATING AND INEQUALITIES IN CHINA'S JUDICIAL MEDIATION,"I propose a three-way model of negotiation on judicial mediation: the judge as a negotiator. Primarily drawing on ethnographic observations of a civil judge in a basic-level court in hinterland China, I document Chinese judges' tactics at the micro level. I find that the Chinese judge not only “expands” and “narrows” claims. In addition, included in her repertoire are “repression,” “conversion,” and “facilitation.” Following this, I explore the inequitable consequences of the judge's apparent success in disposing cases. In negotiating the claims, the judge convinces or cajoles litigants who are economically vulnerable, inexperienced in the courtroom, legally bewildered, or timid in confronting the judges' authority, into the settlement. But she often facilitates the claims of litigants who can mount credible political resistance. The interests of those who are vulnerable in one way or another, but not in a position to initiate political threats, are often dispensed. Inequalities are thus generated, reproduced, and reinforced. This three-way negotiation model provides a new perspective to study judicial mediation comparatively.",Dataset analysis & interviewing,China Law Yearbooks,"This article details a Chinese judge's settlement tactics at the micro level. By repressing, narrowing, converting, expanding, and facilitating claims, judges dispose many of their cases in the name of settlement. When claims are made, the judge's responses are interactive, with constant revision and negotiation. It has thus been demonstrated that the judge is not merely a supervisor of two parties. She herself is an important negotiator. She also sets the agenda for the parties' interaction by drawing on resources of power. While earlier treatments of judicial mediation have implied such a negotiating role for judges (Henderson 1965; Shapiro 1981; Moser 1982; Galanter 1985; Markovits 2002), this article explicitly suggests a three-way model of negotiation."
FROM DATAFICATION TO DATA STATE: MAKING SENSE OF CHINA'S SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM AND ITS IMPLICATIONS,"We live in an age of datafication wherein nearly all aspects of our lives can be transformed into data and evaluated. The authors seek to make sense of the heightened datafication-enabled social control under China's Social Credit System (SCS) by developing the concept of the data state. A “data state” is defined as a governance model enabling the state to comprehensively monitor, evaluate, and control its subjects through datafication, leaving them little room to defend their autonomy. We identify the multiple functions of the SCS in its development up to 2020 and analyze its inherent defects, including the decontextualized evaluation of individuals and the semi-automated imposition of disproportionate punishment. We argue that, if the SCS were to fully integrate its functions and connect to other data-driven governance initiatives, it would eventually allow the data self, carefully groomed by the state, to dominate the bio-self and turn China into a data state. Whereas China's SCS may be unique and not easily replicated elsewhere, understanding its intricacies helps to enable the citizens of democratic societies to guard against the relentless growth of datafication that may result in an invincible and irreversible ecosystem for the emergence of a data state.",Legal analysis,,"Above, we discuss the various salient features of China's SCS. The most striking elements of the ambitious SCS system are the state's potential ability to comprehensively evaluate its citizens' datafied behaviors and the grooming of the data self, with the data self taking precedence over and steering the bio-self. In the end, the bio-self may have to learn how to co-exist with a data self that has completely redefined it in practical terms."
THE LAW OF THE SEA AND PRC GRAY-ZONE OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA,"This Current Development describes the nature and implications of the PRC gray zone strategy for the law of the sea, including both its international and its domestic components.",Legal analysis,,"This Current Development has called attention to the PRC's use of legal gray zone tactics to change the realities in the South China Sea and--as a conscious objective--to undercut the rule of international law. Two brief observations as to dealing with LOSC-focused gray zone operations in the SCS may be distilled from this analysis. First, one way of reducing the effect of gray zone operations that engineer or leverage legal uncertainties is for other states to coordinate and together take a clear, communicated, pre-emptive legal position on issues of status and incident characterization. Second, states should continue to identify and call out instances in which the PRC attempts to manufacture legal uncertainty in order to set the groundwork for further gray zone operations. Ultimately, PRC gray zone operations in the SCS are not simply a political and strategic challenge; some (but not all) of these operations are also worrying from a legal perspective."
THE FACES OF SECURITIES REGULATION AND STATE AUTHORITY: A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA,"This article examines how the organizational structures and purposes of securities regulators affect securities law and its enforcement. Securities regulators in different jurisdictions can have either hierarchical or horizontal organizational structures, and their mission can be either policy-implementing or dispute-resolving. The securities regulators in China and the United States are two typical examples. The two countries can be roughly categorized as activist and reactive states, respectively. This article shows that the organizations of regulators and the disposition of governments affect the ends of securities regulation and provides some evidence that they also affect the means, which would explain the express differences in securities enforcement as well as those applied in practice. While a reactive state mainly seeks to protect investors and facilitate capital formation, an activist state tends to consider other state goals, including industrial policies and redistribution of wealth. Additionally, hierarchically organized securities regulators tend to focus more on technical rules and routines, whereas horizontally organized regulators employ more flexible standards and are better equipped to deliver substantive justice. This article contributes to the literature of law and finance and cautions against the “capital-market-centrist” view.",Legal analysis,,"The legal origin theory of law and finance has become a highly influential theory and has generated important policy implications for many countries.205 Current studies, however, focus mainly on the differences in the judicial systems across jurisdictions and have not fully considered the different institutional designs of securities regulators and their impacts on securities law and enforcement. This article thus fills an important gap in the current literature. By comparing the practice of securities regulations in China and the United States, this article identifies two theoretical models for regulatory authorities--hierarchical and horizontal--each of which may in turn pursue different goals.
The CSRC in China is closer to the hierarchical ideal, whereas the SEC is closer to the horizontal ideal. As Section III illustrates, the design of the regulatory authority in China may have contributed to the relatively formalistic regulation of the IPO process. In addition, while many other factors may account for the differences in securities law and enforcement in China and the United States, Section II describes how the CSRC often pursues state goals apart from protecting shareholders' rights and reducing corporations' cost of capital. As a result, securities regulation in China is drastically different from regulation in the United States. The theoretical framework provided in this article can also explain differences of securities regulation in other jurisdictions, including Germany, Japan, and Australia."
AN ANATOMY OF THE FIRST PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN CHINA,"The city of Shenzhen enacted the first personal bankruptcy legislation in China, setting up a regional experiment for future national legislation. This article presents the structure and the history of the Regulations of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone on Personal Bankruptcy and analyzes the legislation's content under the fabric of the World Bank's Report on the Treatment of the Insolvency of Natural Persons. The Shenzhen Regulation adopts many universally accepted practices, but its mechanisms reflect tailoring of some mechanisms to reflect special needs arising from its unique local background. While the Shenzhen Regulation advances China towards a salient personal bankruptcy system, it still is too early to determine whether any national bankruptcy legislation in China will adopt its principles of framework in whole or in part.",Legal analysis,,"Social and economic transitions in China in the past decades highlight the necessity for a personal insolvency system. Just like their counterparts in other countries, Chinese lawmakers struggle with “negative effects caused by a rapidly rising tide of debt distress among natural persons.”224 Cautious pilot experiments continue in China in Wenzhou, Taizhou, and especially Shenzhen as it implements the first personal bankruptcy regulation in China. This experiment provides experience for future national legislation.
Evaluating the Shenzhen Regulation's core legal attributes for an effective personal insolvency system through the prism of the World Bank Report on the Treatment of the Insolvency of Natural Persons demonstrates that the Regulation contains most of the internationally recognized components for a viable system, tempered by an understanding of local needs. Nevertheless, the Regulation leaves numerous issues outstanding, such as voting rules on reconciliation agreements, handling the burdens of administrative costs, setting thresholds for access standards, incentivizing creditors' participation in *620 the system and approval of plans, and supervising trustees, to list only a few. Implementation might resolve these unsettled questions in the future, but we may not know their answers for some time and the lack of certainty should not prevent immediate improvements in the system as needs demand.
The Shenzhen Regulation offers a beneficial regime for over-indebted debtors, but scholars and policymakers still dispute how best to formulate a personal insolvency system in China, arguing over issues as general as regime design and as specific as the discharge of student loans. As a result, while the Shenzhen Regulation marks a significant achievement in Chinese commercial law, there still is a long way to go to create a complete and efficient personal insolvency system in China."
"VIAGRA DID NOT WORK, BUT MICHAEL JORDAN STILL MADE IT: TRADEMARK POLICY TOWARD THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN MARKS IN CHINA","Most multinational enterprises (MNEs) register their original trademarks in Roman letters in China upon entering the Chinese market. However, many fail to develop and register corresponding Chinese marks because they do not understand local culture and consumers, overvalue consumers' presumed brand loyalty, or neglect the accompanying trademark issues. This failure enables trademark squatters to register and hold the Chinese marks for ransom or local competitors to free ride on foreign marks using their Chinese translations or transliterations. This Article first introduces the complexity of translating a foreign mark into Chinese, which concerns complex linguistic, cultural, and business challenges. Based on recent court decisions, this Article systematically analyzes the legal basis on which an MNE may claim to protect the Chinese equivalent of its original trademarks. This Article then provides essential business and legal implications of China's trademark policy toward translating foreign-language marks into Chinese.",Legal analysis,,"MNEs must register the Chinese equivalents of their trademarks when exploring the Chinese market. However, given the complexity of the Chinese language and culture, there are multiple ways to translate a foreign mark into Chinese, and it is never an easy task for MNEs to choose the most desirable Chinese names. This complexity and the first-to-file trademark regime in the country have provided trademark squatters with great opportunities to hijack the Chinese equivalents of foreign marks, making it increasingly costly for MNEs to enter the Chinese market. Although several provisions in the Chinese Trademark Law protect the Chinese translations of MNEs' foreign-language trademarks, each has its limitations, and not all MNEs can effortlessly overcome them. Based on the systematic analysis of relevant court decisions, we highlight the importance of trademark strategy based on existing judicial practices and sensitivity to market and culture. We also recommend MNEs' proactive use of trademarks in Chinese, through which a stable corresponding relation can be established between the original Roman-letter marks and their Chinese equivalents."
"TIANXIA, OR ANOTHER GROSSRAUM? U.S.--CHINA COMPETITION AND PARADIGM CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER","In this Essay, I try to provide some clarification on the concept of Tianxia from the perspectives of both classical Chinese philosophy and constitutional theory, which Tom Ginsburg nominated as the source of authoritarian international law. My observation is that a paradigm shift is occurring in the international legal order. Tianxia designates the ideal relationships between states in the Chinese classics. And in the new paradigm, Tianxia is expected to integrate the international society. In that sense, I take Tianxia as a regime-neutral ideotype between democratic/Western and authoritarian/non-Western legal order. However, Chinese engagement with international law has shown a tendency towards realism since 1949, and at the root of that realism is Western nationalism. In Carl Schmitt's theory, the latter will finally bring about the plurality of spatial legal order (Grossraum), which gives birth to national and regional legal systems. Accordingly, it is still too early to tell whether China is willing take advantage of the transition to Tianxia.",Legal analysis (law and philosophy),,"Both Hegel and Francis Fukuyama made the fatal error of excluding the non-Western civilization from world history. The new paradigm of international law should be determined not to repeat their mistake. If Jack Balkin can publish a commentary on I Ching and Tom Ginsburg can explain Confucian and Buddhist constitutions, there is no reason to exclude scholars and lawyers affiliated with Western values from taking part in the interpretation of Tianxia."
RETOOLING SANCTIONS: CHINA'S CHALLENGE TO THE LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER,"Professor Tom Ginsburg has produced yet another classic of transnational law, political science, and international relations. Democracies and International Law yields important insights into the democratic nature of international law but cautions that authoritarian states can apply these very legal technologies for repressive or antidemocratic purposes. Building on Ginsburg's theories of mimicry and repurposing, this contribution highlights the role of both techniques in the creation of China's economic sanctions program. On the one hand, China has developed a basic set of tools to impose economic sanctions--a key instrument in the liberal international toolkit--on foreign entities and persons. In so doing, China has adopted elements of American economic sanctions, as well as European directives, to blunt the force of foreign sanctions. On the other hand, China has deployed sanctions for anti-democratic purposes, including squelching free speech, freedom of thought, and academic inquiry. While a full discussion of China's sanctions regime (itself a project under construction) is still premature, the initial imposition of sanctions suggests China is trying to accomplish very different aims than the liberal states that pioneered economic sanctions in the twentieth century.",Legal analysis,,"Professor Ginsburg's Democracy and International Law provides much food for thought on the ways that liberal democracies differ from repressive autocracies in drafting, interpreting, and using international law. In this brief contribution, we have charted how China took an instrument from the toolkit of liberal internationalism and repurposed it into a weapon with which to punish its critics. Western states developed economic sanctions to inflict limited reputational, financial, and operational damage on state or corporate actors engaging in human rights abuses or anti-democratic behavior. To be sure, one can criticize the scope, breadth, and aim of these sanctions, and the extraterritorial effects they bring to bear on actors far beyond American or European shores. Nevertheless, Western sanctions do not generally apply to people for beliefs, opinions, or criticisms they espouse.
China's sanctions regime, up until the present, remains rudimentary. No doubt it will expand in scope, complexity, and sophistication in the years to come. But the past year has already yielded insights into how China will apply sanctions in the short to medium term. It is telling that China has not publicly sanctioned any corporations--perhaps to mollify fears from foreign (non-Chinese) investors about conducting business with a country subject to a widening web of international sanctions. China has, of course, imposed sanctions on high-level political actors from Europe and North America, generally in response to sanctions from those same Western states--a clear instance of mimicry. Where China is breaking new ground--repurposing the sanctions regime--is in targeting foreign critics of the People's Republic. This use of sanctions raises obvious concerns for academics, experts, and observers, whose careers may depend upon access to China. But it also shows how China uses law to advance authoritarian aims: to limit speech, to deflect criticism, and to turn public opinion against those who dare question China's actions or motives."
DARK LAW ON THE SOUTH CHINA SEA,"In Democracies and International Law, Tom Ginsburg warns of an emerging post-liberal order influenced by powerful authoritarian regimes and new illiberal laws that repurpose global rights, undermine international courts, and expand executive power. Autocrats and kleptocrats embedded in the global economy increasingly appear to use international law to preserve their power, protect norms of non-intervention, and enhance the global stability of autocratic rule. Legalistic autocrats, for example, exploit judicial deference and vague statutory language in national security laws to circumvent checks on their authority. This process, which I call “dark law,” aids in the consolidation of state power and the global entrenchment of authoritarianism. In this Essay, I argue that dark law also contributes to the construction of authoritarian international law. Conflicts in the South China Sea illustrate how authoritarian regimes use law to pursue illiberal ends. By disregarding multilateral treaty obligations, resisting third-party adjudication, and repurposing national security laws, authoritarian states sabotage maritime norms and principles. International dark law makes global waterways more dangerous for sailors and fishing communities, undermines international cooperation on marine protection, and threatens maritime accountability and ocean governance. Future protection of oceans and seas depends on state compliance with international law and the effectiveness of multilateral enforcement.",Legal analysis,,"This Essay argues that authoritarian regimes leverage statutory vagueness in domestic security laws to evade international legal obligations and, through this process, contribute to the normative development of authoritarian international law. I advance the concept of dark law as a relational framework for interpreting conflict in the South China Sea and as a way to understand how national security law can erode democratic norms and institutions, both in domestic and international contexts. Legalistic autocrats wield ill-defined statutes in efforts to entrench legal terms and ideas that will buttress authoritarianism in the international system. Conflicts in the South China Sea reveal how Chinese authorities have strategically repurposed domestic laws to undermine UNCLOS. In recent decades, China has emerged as global power and a legalistic state.99 President Xi and the Communist Party appear increasingly willing to employ law to strengthen regime legitimacy. It is vital that the international law community acknowledge and work to limit the development of authoritarian international law.
The question of how to limit authoritarian entrenchment in international law, of course, demands context. Regarding conflicts in the South China Sea, I offer a few modest suggestions. A binding code of conduct for coastal states promises stability that could serve all claimant parties. Strengthening UNCLOS enforcement offers another mechanism to encourage state compliance. Countries and international institutions can do much more to promote multilateralism in maritime governance. Continued failed governance and protection of the world's oceans and seas will have dire consequences for coastal communities and marine ecosystems. Long overdue are a new generation of international agreements that will protect biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions and establish a meaningful system for oceanic accountability."
BARRIERS TO CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT AGAINST COUNTERFEITING IN CHINA,"Multinational companies (MNCs) with valuable trademarks in China seek criminal enforcement against counterfeiting because other available avenues of relief, such as administrative and judicial remedies, have proven to be ineffective. While MNCs prefer enforcement through China's Police, the Public Security Bureau (PSB), many MNCs are unaware of the significant hidden dangers of using the PSB.
Most MNCs will delegate enforcement of trademark rights to their Chinese subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are known to make illegal payments to the PSB that may violate the laws of the PRC as well as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These acts expose MNCs to draconian penalties under PRC law and the FCPA. MNCs can be unaware of these illegal practices because many MNCs organize their business structures and intellectual property (IP) management strategies in ways that shield MNCs from reviewing some of the on-the-ground actions by their Chinese subsidiaries. This Article exposes these risks, explains how some of these risks arise, and makes suggestions on how MNCs can structure their business organizations and IP management structures in China to eliminate or mitigate these risks.",Legal analysis,,"MNCs that rely upon their Chinese subsidiaries to bring criminal enforcement actions against the counterfeiting of their trademark rights may be exposed to risks of which they are unaware. For a number of reasons explained above, the Chinese subsidiary may make payments to the PSB without the knowledge of the MNC. The purpose of this Article is to expose these risks and the conditions that encourage and magnify them. While some of these risks arise purely under the local laws of the PRC, other risks arise under the FCPA and *673 other foreign anti-bribery laws. The risks that such payments can occur without the knowledge of the MNC are highest when its Chinese subsidiary serves as the registered owner of the MNC's trademarks in China. MNCs that allow their subsidiaries to be the registered owner of trademarks in China may be unaware of the risks to which this practice will expose them. This Article has argued that the MNC should always register all important trademarks in its own name and license them to its Chinese subsidiaries. This approach is more complicated and costly than simply allowing the Chinese subsidiary to register the trademarks, but it also mitigates the risks created by the latter approach. Careful advanced planning in accordance with the suggestions set forth in this Article and continuing vigilance by US-based MNCs can eliminate or mitigate many of the dangers lurking in the criminal enforcement against counterfeiting in China."
INTERNATIONAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: CHINA 2021,"This Article provides an overview of the significant decisions of the Chinese courts, in particular the Supreme People's Court of China in 2021. It provides readers with insight into the judicial practice of maritime law over this period in Mainland China. The judgments relate to carriage of goods by sea, marine insurance, and other maritime matters. The source of these Chinese judgments is the database of China Judgement Online. In 2021, Chinese courts have delivered and published 5,054 maritime judgments in Chinese Judgments Online, 87 of which are from the Supreme People's Court.1 The number of judgements from both Chinese courts and the Supreme People's Court in 2021 is about half the number of judgements in 2020.2 It is believed that the decrease in the number of cases is caused by the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19.",Legal analysis,,
THE IMPACT OF GEO-ECONOMIC RIVALRY ON U.S. ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE: WILL THE UNITED STATES INCORPORATE ASPECTS OF CHINA'S STATE-CENTRIC GOVERNANCE?,"China's corporate governance model emphasizes an extensive governmental role in the construction of economic markets. The paradigm consists of an economic-political syndicate of collaborative actors creating profit but whose critical core mission is to advance state objectives as defined by the ruling authority, the CCP. Economic interests thus serve political interests pursuant to a template of state direction and partnership with the private sector encompassing share ownership; industrial policies; governmental representatives embedded in the private sector; and discipline imposed for failing to comply with syndicate rules. The model has empowered China to narrow the once substantial leads enjoyed by the U.S. with respect to economic, technological, and military power. Although the United States has alleged that China's model is unfair and has endeavored to have China de-emphasize its model and move towards the U.S. model of market-capitalism, these efforts have been unsuccessful. Significantly, competitive pressures and national security interests may force the U.S. to embrace one or more aspects of China's economic model. The impetus for doing so is not merely driven by U.S. governmental concerns over China; indeed, some U.S. business leaders have called for a similar role for the U.S. government in order to successfully compete with the Chinese private-sector, let alone State-linked entities. Whether out of competitive pressures or the allure of success, incorporating aspects of China's model is an increasing possibility with significant potential impacts on U.S. corporate governance. This article discusses the drivers militating toward U.S. incorporation of aspects of China's governance model as well as the potential ramifications on U.S. governance.
",Legal analysis,,"While the United States remains the number one economic power, China is a serious and powerful challenger. The Chinese model presents a real difficulty for U.S. governance; without similar industrial policies and state-backing, U.S. firms face a severe competitive disadvantage. Unless China's trajectory changes, China's governance will continue to present both competitive pressures and attractive features militating towards U.S incorporation of aspects of Chinese governance. Such measures might encompass U.S. purchasing of shares (both of domestic and of foreign corporations), subsidies, preferential loans, and industrial policies to provide advantages to national champions. Doing so translates into heightened economic nationalism, acquisitions of strategic corporations to give the U.S. government a dominant or controlling interest, and policies enabling U.S. private and state-linked firms to compete with their Chinese counterparts. While not classic “shareholder-value,” China's model is not classic stakeholder as there is only one real objective other than shareholder-value: to advance the goals established by the state. For portfolio companies, China's economic model is in effect shareholder-value, but the ordinary shareholder is replaced by the “sovereign.” While traditional corporate governance conflicts of interest, as in any corporation with dominant or controlling shareholders, will exist--sovereign controllers are fundamentally different from private controllers. Problems of corruption, excessive debt, and unprofitable state-linked economic actors appear extensively, and Chinese officials admit that reforms are required.
The U.S. national interest clearly is in avoiding such problems. However, just as China's economic interests serve its political domain, U.S. economic interests might be trumped by national security interests leading to incorporation of tenets of China's model, with enormous implications for U.S. corporate governance. U.S. market capitalism has worked for the U.S. However, the U.S. is now facing a longer-term hegemonic rivalry that might require incorporating a state-centric model to compete with China to slow the narrowing of the gap between the U.S. and China and to reverse the trend. Securing the crown of hegemony will likely obligate the U.S. to imitate some degree of China's model. There will likely be a trade-off of some additional inefficiencies. But the heightened inefficiency risk may be viewed as the required temporary price to compete with a model which is not constrained by government strictures in the same fashion as U.S. involvement in the aftermath of the subprime crisis was seen as urgent but temporary. Doing so will have enormous implications for U.S. corporate governance. U.S. adaptation of China's model may be more of a temporary measure as opposed to a long-term model. But it could still have adverse effects during the time the U.S. government has a dominant or controlling interest."
DO SPECIALIZED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COURTS SHOW A PRO-PATENT PROPENSITY? EVIDENCE FROM CHINA,"Intellectual property (IP) is gaining increasing attention in various fields. However, its proper function relies on an effective judicial system. Thus, we compared the results of patent infringement litigations in China between specialized IP courts and general courts. We found that patent holders sue for higher damages at IP courts than in general courts, and IP courts grant higher damages. However, when we controlled the impacts of certain factors, we found that the IP courts do not demonstrate a pro-patent propensity in their judgments. Furthermore, IP courts have not shown significant advantages in their judgments in aspects of speed, the rate of appeals, and the avoidance of mistakes. We also found that litigious plaintiffs are, to some degree, disliked by the courts. This work provides an empirical understanding of the latest situation about patent protection in China and discusses its practical implications.",Dataset analysis (regression),"PKULAW, QICHACHA","We investigated the operation of specialized IP courts in China, which has become an important part of the IP judicial system. More specifically, we compared the judgments of patent litigations between specialized IP courts and general courts. Our work provides empirical understandings about the latest update on IP protection in China. We found that patent holders request more damages when they institute their cases in IP courts than in general courts, and IP courts grant more damages to the plaintiffs. However, IP courts did not show a pro-patent propensity in their judgments after we controlled the impacts of other factors. On the contrary, the general court in Shenzhen is making more favorable judgments to patent holders than IP courts in Beijing and Shanghai. We also found that IP courts are spending more time in hearing and delivering judgments in patent litigations, and patent judgments delivered by IP courts are more likely to go on appeal and varied by higher courts. Furthermore, our study revealed that litigious plaintiffs are to some degree disliked by the courts."
CONSTITUTIONAL SUPERVISION IN CHINA AFTER THE 2018 AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION: REFINING THE NARRATIVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY IN A SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM,"After deflecting calls for a constitutional committee for nearly four decades, why did China's leaders decide to create one at a moment when Xi Jinping is presiding over a significant tightening of the country's political-legal environment? This article argues that the recent reforms should be understood as components of a broad constitutional rationalization designed to refine the Party's narrative of constitutional supremacy, strengthen the legal system as an instrument to discipline the bureaucracy, and contain citizen constitutional argument. The reforms demonstrate the Party's confidence that it can reap the legitimacy and governance benefits of building new constitutional supervision infrastructure without incurring material risks that citizens might leverage such infrastructure to challenge Party authority.",Legal analysis,,"Perhaps then, it is appropriate to characterize the creation of the Constitution and Law Committee and corresponding reforms to the filing and review system as efforts to refine the narrative of socialist constitutional supremacy. While the creation of the Committee involves more than simply a name change, China's leaders chose one of the weakest socialist constitutional supervision models, and they did so only after enhancing the constitutional status of the Party and undertaking a campaign to marginalize competing constitutional visions. When the recent reforms are viewed in this context, they demonstrate the Party's confidence that it dominates China to such a degree that it can reap the legitimacy and governance benefits of answering four decades of calls for specialized constitutional supervision infrastructure without incurring material risks of unintended consequences. The Constitution may be important in Xi's China, but as an instrument of central control, not as a tool for rights enforcement. As one scholar remarked in assessing the impact of Poland's constitutional tribunal prior to 1989, the reform presents “the illusion of constitutional legality without challenging [the system's] most fundamental assumptions.”"
"INSIDERS AND THEIR TRADING GAMES IN CHINA: LAW, ENFORCEMENT DATA, AND A PUZZLING QUESTION","We conducted a comprehensive, up-to-date observation of the enforcement of insider trading Jaw in China. Our observation has a twofold goal First, we examine how a key component of modern securities Jaw--insider trading Jaw--is enforced in a rapidly growing economy where both regulators and market participants are relatively lacking in experience and must learn to communicate with one another and establish an effective model of Jaw enforcement. Second, we use this observation as a Jens for understanding how corporate information flows in a concentrated ownership environment. In theory, controlling shareholders can either voluntarily push for corporate information flow to the general public to win investor confidence, or they can trade for their own private benefit with an informational advantage and keep that information private as long as possible and bet that law enforcement does not detect it. Alternatively, company controllers may opt for a third option, which is to tacitly allow corporate managers to trade with undisclosed corporate information as a form of managerial compensation without conducting any insider trading themselves. Which scenario is more likely is unclear, but China's concentrated ownership environment makes it a good setting for testing these possibilities.",Dataset analysis (event study),China Judgments Online,"In this Article, we expanded on the research method from the authors' previous research. We used CAR and the degree of pre-announcement run-up as a proxy for information leakage to measure the effectiveness of insider trading law enforcement in China. We also combined data we collected from previous work and work from other researchers in a multilayer comparison, with which we sought to paint a complete picture of insider trading law, its enforcement, the quality of enforcement, and traders' motivations and behaviors in China.
We originally intended to use insider trading as a lens to observe the behavioral patterns of corporate controllers and the way they use private corporate information. From observing data, enforcement, and comparison group of M&A data combined, it can be ascertained that weak enforcement leads to many instances of pre-announcement information leakage. But whether those information leaks come from controllers or managers and if controllers use it as a form of compensation, as suggested by Manne, cannot be proven with the information at hand.
We have the following closing observation to make. From a normative perspective, our findings suggest that a greater enforcement endeavor is needed to reduce the information asymmetry or expropriation between corporate insiders and the general public, which will, in turn, foster investor confidence. However, enhanced enforcement does not guarantee improvement if the case-selection criteria remain unclear, random, or based on political considerations."
JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DIRECTORS' DUTY OF CARE: A COMPARISON BETWEEN U.S. & CHINA,"Articles 147 and 148 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China (“Chinese Company Law”) establish that directors owe a duty of care to their companies.1 However, both of these provisions fail to explain the role of judicial review in enforcing this duty. The duty of care is a well-trodden territory in the United States, where directors' liability is predicated on specific standards. The current American standard, adopted by many states, requires directors to “discharge their duties with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances.”2 However, both the business judgment rule and Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporate Law (“DGCL”) shield directors from responsibility for their actions, which may weaken the impact of the duty of care requirement on director behavior.
To better allocate the responsibility for directors' violations of the duty of care and promote the corporations' development, it is essential that Chinese company law establish a unified standard of review governing the duty of care owed by directors *598 to companies. The majority of Chinese legal scholars agreed that a combination of subjective and objective standards would function best.3 Questions remain regarding how to combine such standards and implement them. In order to promote the development of China's duty of care, these controversial issues need to be solved. This Article argues that China's Company Law should hold a first-time violator of the duty of care liable only in cases of gross negligence but hold directors liable in the cases of ordinary negligence if they have violated the duty of care in the past.",Legal analysis,,"Most of the corporate laws of common law systems and civil law systems countries set up the concept of duty of care. The application of the duty of care in various countries can allow countries and corporations to learn from each other, which is conducive to the development of corporate law itself. America's dichotomy of the standard of conduct and standard of review and gross negligence standards weakens the importance of duty of care. The U.S. should pay attention to the possible consequences of this issue and therefore change how academic scholars and practitioners only focus on the duty of loyalty and ignore the duty of care. The improvement measures that the U.S. may take include, but are not limited to, narrowing the gap between MBCA 8.30 and 8.31. The experience of the U.S. provides valuable governance principles for the establishment of China's duty of care standard. Chinese courts can choose which standard to adopt according to whether the director has a violation record or not. Unified standards will make the trial results of different cases more coherent and consistent and reduce the appeal rate to a certain extent. In addition, more discretion should be given to judges in judicial practice, and more detailed case analyses should be encouraged."
THE TEMPORALITY OF LAW IN TRADITIONAL CHINA AND ITS CONTEMPORARY IMPLICATIONS,"Temporality of law is of great significance in traditional Chinese juridico-political thought, and its influence plays a crucial role in China's state building and governance. The existing temporal phrases from the West are not sufficient for explaining the symbol-oriented legal system in traditional China. Formalist law overlooks the temporal elements intrinsic to the legal system and results in the failure of governance. This Article applies a historical culture paradigm to analyze the temporality of law in traditional China by using plurality, sociality, and rhetoric as indicators to demonstrate the contestation of temporal categories in penality, socialization of seasonal time, and the transcending moral discourse in law, as well as by examining the temporal relevance in the classical textual and cultural context of traditional China. The Article further shows that the intertemporal dynamism in law facilitated the formation of a unified and stable system of order over China's long imperial period. The intertemporality in traditional Chinese law still exerts huge influence on legal governance in contemporary China.",Legal analysis (law and philosophy),,"The temporality of law in traditional China must be explored at the level of the philosophical and cosmological concepts of the nature and purpose of order in the universe. Differentiated temporal frameworks in law can be deduced from references to traditional classics of major ancient schools of thought. It is reasonable to maintain that temporality is an important dimension for law to have a desirable effect in traditional China. Overlooking law's temporality will lead to static governance that causes damage to any sovereignty. Using the historical culture paradigm, one can broaden the approach to understanding and interpreting Chinese legal development."
THE DECLINE AND RESURGENCE OF PEOPLE'S MEDIATION IN CHINA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CHINESE PROVINCES,"In this paper, we employ 32 years (1985-2016) of province-level data from China to test a variety of factors thought to influence the development of people's mediation rates. Results suggest that legislative reforms, numbers of underlying disputes, economic development, and demographic shifts are related to people's mediation rates. Notably, we do not find evidence of a substitution effect of litigation for people's mediation - a commonly cited reason for the decline of people's mediation in the 1990s and early 2000s. To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct such empirical tests.",Dataset analysis (regression),China Statistical Yearbooks,"The decline and resurgence of people's mediation in China is well documented, yet until now, proposed explanations for people's mediation trends have not been tested. In the current analysis, we review theories of mediation development and utilize 32 years of province-level people's mediation rate data to test those theories.
Perhaps the most cited explanation for the decline of people's mediation rates from 1990 to the mid-2000s is China's turn toward litigation. From 1990 to 2004, the number of civil lawsuits rose by nearly 34 percent, while the number of people's mediation claims fell by over 40 percent.97 Nevertheless, in examining a wider time interval from 1985 to 2016, we find that annual litigation and mediation claims moved in the same direction more often than in opposite directions.
In an empirical analysis of people's mediation rates, we do not find evidence of a substitution effect of litigation for mediation. This result holds regardless of whether one examines the period of mediation decline or our entire study period. Instead, we observe that declining people's mediation rates are associated with rising levels of educational attainment and urbanization as well as changes in economic output and composition across economic sectors. Highly educated, urban individuals likely derive fewer benefits from people's mediation, while structural changes in the Chinese economy may yield more complicated disputes that are less suitable to people's mediation."
TRANSPLANTING ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTIONS,"When adjudicating high-value cases involving the licensing of patents covering industry standards such as Wi-Fi and 5G (standards-essential patents or SEPs), courts around the world have increasingly issued injunctions preventing one party from pursuing parallel litigation in another jurisdiction (anti-suit injunctions or ASIs). In response, courts in other jurisdictions have begun to issue anti-anti-suit injunctions, or even anti-anti-anti suit injunctions, to prevent parties from hindering the proceedings in those courts. Most of these activities have been limited to the United States and Europe, but in 2020 China emerged as a powerful new source of ASIs in global SEP litigation. The comparative law literature uses the notion of legal transplant to describe the introduction of a foreign legal concept, rule, or procedure. Taking the view that the emergence of ASIs in China represents a new form of transplant from Western legal systems, this Article analyzes the transplantation of this procedural mechanism to China. This recent development can be viewed as both surprising, given China's civil law tradition, and predictable, considering the country's prominence in global technology markets. Equally predictable have been the strong reactions of foreign courts and policymakers to China's use of this mechanism, which has now proceeded at a pace that outstrips that of any other country. This Article traces the emergence of ASIs in China by examining how the Chinese legal system has adapted a procedural mechanism that has been repeatedly used in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Article further elucidates the internal and external forces that led to the mechanism's rapid adoption in China. It sheds new light on the process of legal transplantation in the twenty-first century as well as its global ramifications.",Legal analysis,,"This Article concludes by calling for a renewed emphasis on international comity. Such an emphasis will be important not only for reducing international jurisdictional battles in global FRAND litigation and other contexts, but also for minimizing the complications and unintended consequences caused by proactive legal transplants. The principle of international comity also reflects a widely settled international consensus. Thanks to legal transplants, Chinese courts have now joined U.S. courts in considering the impact on international comity before issuing an ASI, AASI, or AAASI."
AGILITY OVER STABILITY: CHINA'S GREAT REVERSAL IN REGULATING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY,"This Article develops the five-element HAPPY model to study Chinese regulation: the regulatory process is hierarchical, the top leadership is adaptable, the Chinese regulators are parochial, the firms are pliant and the Chinese public need to yelp to be heard. By focusing on China's great reversal in regulating the platform economy, I show that Chinese policy volatilities have stemmed from the hierarchical structure in which power is centralized among top leaders, who also suffer from a chronic deficit of information. I particularly highlight how favorable support from the top leadership, aggressive lobbying from tech firms, and the bureaucratic inertia of the regulators together contributed to a lag in regulating Chinese online platforms. When a crisis looms, the top leadership quickly mobilizes all administrative resources and propaganda to initiate a law enforcement campaign against tech giants. However, without strong judicial oversight, aggressive agency interventions create the risk of over-enforcement and administrative abuse. Thus far, China's reorientation of its policy control has significantly bolstered its regulatory capacity across various fronts including financial, antitrust, and data regulation. By exerting greater oversight over platform governance, the government has enhanced the bargaining power of the various platform participants in dealing with the platforms. The government's heavy-handed approach has also afforded it great leverage to nudge tech firms to prioritize developing cutting-edge technologies, and to steer them away from foreign stock markets, thus reducing reliance on the West for both technologies and capital. Despite the campaign's immediate impact, it remains to be seen whether it will bring about lasting changes, especially in light of the persistent lobbying from tech firms and the risk of regulatory capture. At the same time, the volatile policy swing has itself generated risks and uncertainties, which in turn could cause turmoil to domestic social and financial stability. As the rest of the world is similarly confronted with thorny questions about how to rein in Big Tech, China's experience with platform regulation could offer some lessons that inform the global policy debate. Although this Article focuses primarily on the platform economy, the HAPPY model has the promise to shed light on the complexity and dynamics in other areas of regulatory governance in China and beyond.",Legal analysis,,"In this article, I develop the HAPPY model containing five essential elements to study Chinese regulation: the regulatory process is hierarchical, the top leadership is adaptable, the Chinese regulators are parochial, the firms are pliant, and the Chinese public need to yelp to be heard. By focusing on China's great reversal in regulating the platform economy, I show that policy volatilities have stemmed from the hierarchical regulatory structure in which power is centralized among top leaders, who also suffer from a chronic deficit of information. I particularly highlight how favorable support from top leadership, aggressive lobbying from tech firms, and the bureaucratic inertia of the regulators together contributed to a lag in regulating Chinese online platforms. As platforms gain pervasive influence, public dissatisfaction grows. The aggressive regulatory arbitrage sought by the platforms jeopardized the bureaucratic interests of Chinese financial regulators, who stepped out to voice public dissent and reported the matter to the top leaders. As soon as they became informed, top leaders quickly mobilized all administrative resources to initiate a massive enforcement campaign against Chinese tech firms. Chinese tech firms swiftly adapted to the regulatory demands of agencies and adhered to the top leadership's new policy initiatives."
HAS CHINA'S LABOR CONTRACT LAW CURTAILED ECONOMIC GROWTH?,"As China reformed its economy during the past forty-four years, it experienced the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history with an annual rate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging nearly 10% from 1978 to 2018. In the past decade, however, the rate of growth has noticeably slowed, falling to just under 7% in 2018, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Though many nations might consider GDP growth over 6% admirable, in China it has sparked a debate about the causes of the slowdown. One suspect is China's 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL), which provides workers with certain rights against firings and other adverse employment actions. Critics of the law claim its provisions threaten to stifle the Chinese economy by unduly restricting employers' ability to terminate unproductive workers and adjust their workforce to changing economic conditions. In the past, the Chinese government strongly supported the LCL. The issue today is whether that support should continue.
This Article provides the first detailed comparative study of the LCL and reveals that Chinese law imposes constraints no more restrictive than the average among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. This Article also challenges the contention that provisions of the LCL have caused slower growth and adversely affected Chinese labor markets. Theoretical models generate only ambiguous and inconsistent predictions concerning the effects of employment protections on labor market performance. And the available empirical evidence likewise fails to show any consistent pattern of adverse effects associated with employment protection laws. We argue that this economic literature casts considerable doubt on the causal claim that Chinese labor law has reduced the country's growth rate or depressed employment. Limited coverage and under enforcement further diminish the likelihood that China's labor regulations have harmed the economy. Thus, the Chinese government should look skeptically on claims that reducing the employment protections in the LCL will reignite economic growth.",Legal analysis,,"We conclude, therefore, where we began by expressing profound skepticism that reforming the LCL will reignite economic growth in China. This story has been told in many places and at many times before. Despite their superficial plausibility, claims about reform ignore reality. From a global perspective, the LCL is not unusually stringent. The law has never been vigorously enforced. And the available empirical evidence casts doubt on the idea that increasing labor flexibility will spur employment and growth. A more defensible stance towards the LCL would invite input from scholars and stakeholders about how to ease compliance and streamline enforcement of the law's provisions."
RETHINKING THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF MIGRANT DOMESTIC WORKERS: THE HETERODOX CASE OF INFORMAL FILIPINA WORKERS IN CHINA,"This Article uses an interview-based case study to challenge the conventional wisdom in international labor law that formality--including formal contracts and special migration programs--always produces better jobs for transnational migrant workers than informality. Interviews with informal Filipina domestic workers in China--often visa overstayers working outside any legally recognized labor migration program--revealed that, despite working without formal status, they earned higher wages and enjoyed more favorable working conditions relative to other Asian labor markets for migrant domestic workers. National regimes of immigration law, which shape the negotiation, formation, and enforcement of the labor contract between the foreign worker and the domestic employer, explain this paradox. Typical labor migration programs (e.g., Singapore's) tie the worker's immigration status to a specific labor contract, the breach of which results in prompt deportation. In contrast, such connections between workplace strategies and immigration law measures are more uncertain and leave more room for *964 parties to negotiate in the informal Chinese market. These contingencies between immigration law enforcement and job status paradoxically enable workers to renegotiate both the employer and the structure of their jobs after arrival, which significantly enhances their bargaining power inside and outside the workplace household. This Article conducts a cross-jurisdiction comparison between a formal program in Singapore and the informal market in China and makes a compelling argument for using a comparative-bargaining-power framework to evaluate how contracts and background rules distribute power and risk among parties in the global care chain. This approach joins the emerging scholarly critiques of the International Labor Organization's almost exclusive focus on formalization to advance migrant workers' conditions.",Field work,,"How shall we interpret this heterodox case of informal labor migration in the context of global labor governance?
I am by no means arguing that this case study informs the debate as a “good practice” example that can or should be replicated across other jurisdictions. Living undocumented in China can be cruel and precarious. The workers must make a tradeoff between losing the job opportunities in this jurisdiction and not being able to return to their home country for years. The prosperous informal market is contingent on the Chinese government's lenient attitude towards enforcement. The whole industry of migrant labor, informal or formal, has become more unpredictable than ever due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the scale of labor emigration from the Philippines in general has shrunk for the first time in the past decade. The fear of contracting the virus drives both the sending and receiving countries to be more xenophobic than usual, which put the migrants and returning migrants at unprecedented risk.
Instead, the local reverse of the formal/informal hierarchy challenges the entrenched presumption in international labor law that informal work is always worse than its formal counterpart. It shows that both informal and formal regimes can produce different packages of benefits and risks and rules working in favor of or against the workers. A considerable number of workers, with varying levels of knowledge and options, prefer the compromises in an informal system when the alternative formal system works significantly to their disadvantage. This is not an attempt to reverse the dichotomy or a naive celebration of the informal. Instead, I urge international labor law scholars and practitioners to look beyond legality into concrete distributional rules in a case-by-case manner. This approach necessitates understanding the informal economy from within and from the workers' perspectives. This more contextualized approach better aligns the pro-labor agenda with the needs of various worker groups.
I further propose that bargaining power is a more meaningful framework to analyze, evaluate, and compare specific regimes, and to lead prospective labor reforms. Bargaining power can be measured in quantifiable metrics such as incomes and working conditions. More importantly, the bargaining power framework attends to the workers' control over the work-related relationships that both formal and informal rules enable. The workers' control over their work and life is especially salient for domestic workers, whose employment relations inside the household workplace emerge out of a tradition of subordination and servitude, and their personal life often gets subsumed into this employment relationship. Given the intimate nature of the work, intrusion and subordination can happen in numerous subtle forms beyond what domestic and international law can possibly regulate. Thus, transforming the asymmetrical bargaining power structure itself has a more fundamental impact than prohibiting its specific manifestations.
In addition, this case raises a local critique to the status quo formal regime of labor migration, especially for migrant domestic workers. Studying the counterexample of an informal market reveals the paradoxical role of the law, particularly the interplay between contracts and immigration law, in entrenching the asymmetrical power structure between migrant domestic workers and employers in the formal regime. By quickly turning to a formalization agenda, the ILO has failed to sufficiently challenge the limitations within these formal arrangements."
"SPECIAL COURTS, GLOBAL CHINA","This Article analyzes China's turn to specialized courts as a case study on how China's global ambitions are shaping its domestic law reforms. It argues that the country's rapid construction of more technocratic special courts in areas such as cyberspace and global commerce is best understood as a product of certain political benefits associated with judicial specialization. These include several internal-facing benefits often cited in China law scholarship: reducing agency problems posed by local actors, for example, or minimizing political risk. But they also include newer benefits keyed to a number of grand strategic priorities. What the evidence makes clearest, in fact, is that China's planners see specialized courts as a means of accelerating a limited set of professional reforms to further the party-state's developmental, technological, and geopolitical goals. Far from a precursor to liberalization, professional specialization is now being marshaled in an effort to service China's global strategies.",Legal analysis,,"The case of special courts illustrates some of the emerging themes: growing professionalism and capacity in key areas, increasing centralization of strategy, and continued tensions between the two.
China's pursuit of professional special courts likely would not have occurred but for the ascendant priorities that inspired them. Each court has been rooted, rhetorically and practically, in Xi-era national strategies, and each was approved by the Party's leading Xi-chaired reform commission. Central leaders were the ones who sent out signals on the primacy of innovation, standard setting, and BRI, and who ultimately endorsed a judicial reform program stressing professional specialization as a “guarantee” for these aims. The speed at which these courts have been constructed suggests that they are more than an idiosyncratic trend or a minor concession to pragmatic court leaders--instead, they are best understood as concerted national strategy.
The seeming compatibility of at least some professional virtues with Party rule and Party aspirations may give pause to those who have sought legal reform in China as a path to political liberalization or a democratic peace. While sophisticated Western advocates of Chinese law reform in the 1980s and 1990s were not avowedly pursuing a project of democratization through law, a great many Western politicians and civil society leaders believed that economic-law reforms would, once adopted, “take on a life of their own” and induce political change. In the words of one State Department official: “Once the Chinese open the door to legal reform, they won't be able to control it.” But as others cautioned as early as 2000, the Chinese government might very well be able to introduce “extensive legal and judicial reform in certain areas” and at the same time “maintain close control over politically sensitive issues.” This Article shows how judicial specialization can play a leading role in driving and maintaining this duality."
"THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD TO EFFECTIVE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN CHINA

","In November 2020, China adopted the Third Amendment to the Copyright Law, providing a major overhaul of its copyright regime. This Amendment entered into effect on June 1, 2021. The last time the regime was completely revamped was in October 2001, when the Copyright Law was amended two months before China joined the World Trade Organization. While U.S. policymakers and industry groups have had mixed reactions to the recent Amendment, the new law presents an opportunity to take stock of the progress China has made in the copyright reform process. This Article begins by mapping the long and winding road to effective copyright protection in China, especially in relation to U.S. rights holders. It then focuses on the recent Amendment, highlighting five sets of upgrades or changes while offering some overarching observations. The Article concludes by identifying five road tips to help copyright holders accelerate the trip toward their destination of effective copyright protection.",Legal analysis,,"In June 2021, the Third Amendment to the Chinese Copyright Law entered into effect, ushering in stronger protection for copyrighted works--domestic and foreign alike. Although copyright holders, especially those from the United States and other overseas markets, have been traveling on a long and winding road in China for more than three decades, they are now closer to their destination of effective copyright protection than they were the last time the Chinese copyright regime was completely revamped. Yet, that road remains fraught with roadblocks and surprises.
To enable copyright holders to accelerate the trip toward their final destination, this Article offers five helpful road tips. While these tips were developed with the long and winding road in China in mind, many--and likely all--of them are useful for similar road trips in other parts of the world. Improving protection for authors and artists requires not only legal upgrades but also a holistic understanding and appreciation of the entire copyright ecosystem. The sooner copyright holders and their supportive policymakers and commentators can develop such an understanding and the needed appreciation, the quicker these right holders can reach their destination of effective copyright protection in China."
"COURTS AS MONITORING AGENTS: THE CASE OF CHINA

","This paper shows that courts are not only a crucial part of the rule of law in the conventional sense, but that they can also serve an important function in revealing information to the central government about the performance of lower level governments. When courts function in this informative way, the central government is able to improve the performance of lower level governments. After developing a general argument in that vein, the recent reforms to the Chinese court system are partially interpreted as an attempt to make the courts monitoring agents for the central government. Based on primary data from more than 1000 Chinese local courts, the argument is tested empirically and its hypotheses are largely confirmed.",Dataset analysis (regression),"multiple sources, unbalanced dataset drawn from 1264 BPCs and covering the period 2011-2017","This study investigates the role of courts in monitoring the behavior of local government in China among other channels. In authoritarian states, government faces the problem of establishing a reliable channel for gathering information on the behavior of local governments. We argue that courts that are independent from local governments can provide information about the performance of local government. The mere knowledge that their performance is monitored in such a way is likely to lead to better governance by local governments. Private parties bring individual cases against public servants to the court, and such cases offer the central government necessary information on whether local governments are behaving wrongfully. Yet, even when performing the role of third-party monitor, courts encounter severe obstacles. A major obstacle to independence is the external interference from local administrative organs. The legal reforms implemented several years ago aimed at removing that obstacle by introducing the RSCD system. This system gave courts the role of passively accepting cases and centralized the management of court personnel and court budget to the province level. Both RSCD and Management Reform significantly reduced interference of local administrative organs into both court proceedings and decisions. Our empirical results show that after the implementation of the reform, the number of administrative cases filed and resolved increased significantly, and although fewer plaintiffs choose to withdraw, the winning rate remains virtually unchanged.
There are, of course, certain issues that need to be dealt with before courts can optimally function as information providers. For example, although the implementation of the RSCD greatly alleviates the difficulties in getting administrative cases filed, these difficulties are unlikely to be removed entirely. Courts still have the chance to get involved through “procedural review”. In addition, courts cannot guarantee that their judgements are fully enforced, and a mechanism is needed to protect plaintiffs from any form of retaliation. The current legal reform only frees courts from local governments' intervention, but they are now more vulnerable to intervention from higher level governments."
"THE INTERNET ECHO CHAMBER AND THE MISINFORMATION OF JUDGES: THE CASE OF JUDGES' PERCEPTION OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IN CHINA

","In authoritarian regimes, without voting as a channel to gather public preferences, online public expression may become a major type of public opinion the government collects. However, online information can be biased and thereby mislead decision-makers. Combining data from a survey of judges and a national population survey, this article provides evidence that i) Chinese judges rely on online public opinion to infer public attitudes toward the death penalty, ii) online information is biased--online opinion is more punitive than the general public opinion, and, iii) biased online information seems to have a strong influence on judges' perception of strong public support for the death penalty, and this may explain why Chinese scholars, lawyers, and other practitioners have persistently overestimated public punitiveness. The findings reveal a less discussed peril of the internet echo chamber: its misleading effect on the information collection process of the government, especially in autocracies.",Dataset analysis (regression),"Author survey, “Judicial Decisions and Public Attitudes”; China Family Panel Studies (CFPS)","The analysis of public punitiveness in China identifies a different type of internet echo chamber than before. The absence of democratic institutions such as voting and polling facilitates the creation of this echo chamber. The problems mentioned above could be greatly reduced if better information channels such voting and polling were available, so that representative views of the public could be collected and information bias online could be corrected. In autocracies, however, elections and voting are usually a sham and opinion polling is often heavily regulated, rendering it difficult, if not impossible, to gather precise information on public attitudes. In fact, very few firms conduct general public opinion polls in China, and because of the general political and regulatory environment, these firms never touch upon politically sensitive topics, such as the death penalty.
As noted, mainstream Chinese scholars and practitioners agree that China should limit its use of capital punishment, but they express skepticism about the possibility of abolition in the near future. They consider prevailing public support for the death penalty a major concern. Many Chinese citizens regard capital punishment as a just and deserved response to certain crimes, according to this view, and the state experiences pressure to carry out capital punishment to express the people's will. The evidence reviewed in this article suggests that the conventional wisdom is problematic. Public support for the death penalty is strong, but not as strong as is widely believed, and the majority--even among supporters of the death penalty--would accept life imprisonment without parole as a replacement for execution. Moreover, scholars have long argued that practice of the death penalty in China is based on such traditional considerations as the belief that “the killer should be killed”; they consider that these traditional conceptions remain contemporary cultural norms (Chen, 2003; Gao, 2004). However, this stereotypical assumption oversimplifies the issue. In fact, the rate of support for capital punishment in mainland China is lower than in other jurisdictions where similar East Asian cultures and values are prevalent.
It is also relevant to ask whether, for practitioners and policy makers in China, public support is a reason, or simply an excuse, to retain the death penalty. In other words, they may support the death penalty for other reasons (for example, to fight crime or maintain social stability), but they clothe their real reasons with assertions of public support for execution as a convenient justification. The sincerity of policy makers seems beyond the scope of this article, but worth separate treatment. The above survey of real judges, however, suggests that they seriously believe that public support for the death penalty is overwhelming. Recall that the judges surveyed were candid. They did not hesitate to admit that public support influenced judicial decisions in high-profile capital cases.
Even in autocracies, policy makers rely on public support in many areas to maintain the regime's legitimacy. When online opinion becomes policy makers' major source of information, perils emerge. I show this problem in the context of the public attitude toward the death penalty, a seemingly ideal domain for that demonstration, due to its moral and value-laden characteristics. We can expect that the perils of the internet echo chamber have appeared in a wide range of areas relevant to public opinion and policy making, beyond the misperception of public support for the death penalty."

"DOES THE REVISED U.S. SOUTH CHINA SEA POLICY GO FAR ENOUGH?

",,Legal analysis,,"Regional friends and allies are looking for U.S. leadership to maintain a rules-based legal order that respects all nations' sovereignty, independence, and economic well-being. Success in this regard will depend, in part, on changing the narrative in the SCS. The United States cannot successfully execute a revised SCS strategy that continues to embrace the failed policies of previous administrations. Continued reliance on the ineffective 1995 policy is a recipe for failure and facilitates PRC hegemony over the Indo-Pacific region in the near term, and more alarming, impacts regional stability in the long term. If the United States is to preserve its position as the preeminent naval power in the region, the United States must not acquiesce in unilateral acts designed to prevent States from exploiting their natural resources, as well as restrict navigational rights and freedoms, and other lawful uses of the seas, guaranteed to all nations. Only then will other States be encouraged to support policies that counter the PRC's malign behavior and help ensure a safe, secure, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific region for all."
"CHINA'S SANCTIONS AND RULE OF LAW: HOW TO RESPOND WHEN CHINA TARGETS LAWYERS
",,Legal analysis,,"The democratic-liberal world has faced geopolitical challenges before, but the challengers in the past, though using a wide range of tactics, seldom used sanctions.157 Sanctions that exclude an individual or a firm from a market are useless if nobody wants in that market. The USSR, the democratic-liberal world's chief competitor from 1945 to 1989, was not a market that very many individuals or firms in the free world were eager to enter.158 The USSR, therefore, did not attain strategic objectives by using sanctions *187 against individuals or firms in the free world.159 By contrast, many around the world are eager to participate in China's market.160 A PRC sanctions law that excludes a professional or commercial actor from China's market, therefore, has the potential to be an effective tool in China's international relations.161 China indeed now has begun to use sanctions.
The initial indications are that China has aimed its sanctions smartly. The recent experience with China's Essex Court sanctions suggests that the legal profession will respond quickly to a sanctions threat.162 The Essex Court sanctions were aimed at a small number of lawyers but carried an unmistakable message to the legal profession at large: cross China, and face consequences.163 The United States, United Kingdom, and like-minded countries should be concerned if China targets any industry with sanctions, but China's targeting of the legal profession should occasion particular concern.164 The legal services industry is not just another industry. In a society based on rule of law, it is vital to every aspect of society.165 To change the operating code of the legal profession the way that China seeks would be to change society in fundamental ways.166 It is China's concept of “legal warfare,” which other writers have recently addressed,167 directed against law itself.
The change that China seeks by targeting lawyers with sanctions is in service to geopolitical objectives that China's leaders openly articulate.168 Nation-states functioning on the basis of democratic-liberal principles are at odds with the “harmonious society” that China says will come to pass when China returns to its natural place as the central polity and political system of *188 the world.169 Accordingly, those principles--the operating system of rule-of-law societies--must give way to China's conception of governance if China is to achieve its aspiration in the stated way."
"THE RISE OF NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN GLOBAL SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS: A NEW HYBRID MODEL IN CHINA

","Developing an appropriate legal mechanism to aggregate claims in mass securities disputes has long been a key policy issue in investor protection around the globe. The lawyer-led opt-out class action regime in the United States has generated by far the most collective securities lawsuits in the world, and yet the system remains subject to much criticism. To facilitate claims while precluding a litigious legal culture like in the United States, many jurisdictions have experimented with innovative procedural rules for collective redress. In particular, the European Union has allowed non-profit organizations (NPOs) to replace the role of entrepreneurial lawyers in representing mass tort victims. Under the NPO-led opt-out regime, the opt-out rule allows parties to resolve similar disputes all at once, while the non-profit and non-distribution attributes of NPOs suppress the filing of frivolous lawsuits.
The new Chinese hybrid model, adopted in the 2020 Securities Law Amendment, entrusts a government-sanctioned NPO, the China Securities Investors Service Center (the CSISC), to represent investors in opt-out class actions and only allows lawyers to lead opt-in collective litigation. This model takes a middle ground by combining both market-driven and government-controlled mechanisms. However, in China, the distinct policy of maintaining social stability and the political embeddedness of the judiciary will likely suppress the number of securities class actions. Indeed, the first opt-out class action shows traces of political influence and control over the whole litigation process, and the close ties between the CSISC and the government also raise doubts about the potential political influences that shape enforcement decisions. Nonetheless, the new Chinese hybrid model offers a comparative law reference for jurisdictions that are reluctant to accept a litigious legal culture, but at the same time, hope to enhance private enforcement of securities law.",Legal analysis,,"This Article critically assesses the latest developments in global securities class action regimes and introduces the key features of the new Chinese hybrid model. This hybrid model exemplifies an innovative regulatory breakthrough that endeavors to integrate different legal practices from other jurisdictions into the local Chinese legal environment. The U.S. lawyer-led model is subject to much criticism, and the Chinese experience importantly points in a new direction: the NPO-led opt-out regime. Non-profit and non-distribution attributes render NPOs suitable candidates to lead class actions because they avoid conflicts of interest between lawyers and investors and the litigious legal culture resulting from the U.S. lawyer-led model. Recent reforms in the European Union's collective redress mechanism further attest to the practicability and feasibility of the NPO-led model.
Another novelty of the Chinese hybrid model is that it embraces certain aspects of the U.S. experience by allowing entrepreneurial lawyers to participate in the opt-in scheme. This model takes a middle ground by combining both market-driven and government-controlled mechanisms. However, a close examination of the judicial interpretation published by the SPC and the first opt-out class action shows traces of political influence and control over the whole securities collective redress mechanism. Indeed, the policies of maintaining social stability and avoiding confrontational litigation greatly shape the contours of the new investor-protection regime in China. While there appears to be a formal convergence in procedural rules between the United States and China, the differences in political values and legal infrastructure are determinative of the reform's outcomes. Ultimately, the new Chinese hybrid model offers an innovative comparative law reference for jurisdictions that are reluctant to accept a litigious legal culture, but at the same time, hope to enhance private enforcement of securities law."
"DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S TRADE SECRETS LAW IN THE US' SHADOW: NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHINA AND SUGGESTIONS

","China's trade secrets protections are not the result of developments in its own industry, but rather the outcomes of US--China trade negotiations. This article is a first attempt at comprehensively examining how the US has affected the development of China's trade secrets regime, primarily through its strong Special 301 process. Based on the historical development route, it is argued that every legal amendment to add stricter rules to the regime to enhance legislative protection levels in China followed US “recommendations.” Such a development path has resulted in the current trade secrets protection regime's lack of accounting for local industry's needs and interests. Evidence demonstrates that the current strict trade secrets regime in China exceeds the local industry's needs and may impede local industrial innovations. The interests of local industry are being neglected because of the substantial representation of US industrial interests in China's legal amendments. Since the US industry's interests conflict considerably with the interests of local industry, the current strict regime in China may only benefit the US industry by preserving their competitive edge at the expense of unduly impeding the development of the local industry. Meanwhile, this evolutionary path has made many local scholars take trade secrets protection for granted and put the research focus mainly on further enhancing protections, without taking a step back to examine basic theories and limiting doctrines. In light of the development route and the accompanying negative consequences, this article suggests some directions that China may move towards at the legislative, academic, and enforcement levels. The author seeks not to repudiate the benefits of the current strict Chinese rules for effectively protecting trade secrets and only suggests instituting more reasonable limiting doctrines to enable the country's trade secrets law to better serve its policy goals.",Legal analysis,,"China's trade secrets protection law is not a product of its own industry's growth, but rather the outcome of US--China trade negotiations.

"BETWEEN THE PREROGATIVE AND THE NORMATIVE STATES: THE EVOLVING POWER TO DETAIN IN CHINA'S POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM

","This article uses Ernst Fraenkel's dual-state framework as an analytical tool to study those conflicting imperatives and constitutional tensions with a focus on the power to detain. This article makes the argument that China has emerged as a dual state with a normal state that functions increasingly with a rule-based government in inter-personal matters and a prerogative state that solidifies control in areas that are regarded as political sensitive. Overall, while the equilibrium between the normative and prerogative states has been evolving in China, it has remained stable. The Party has been able to build a relatively self-defined and self-referencing legal system to provide the certainty and order that the Chinese political economy demands while maintaining a zone of exception, expansive and continuing to evolve, for the prerogative state to safeguard authoritarian rule.",Legal analysis,,"In post-Mao China, the Party started to rebuild a legal system in a larger authoritarian context that co-existed with a resilient prerogative state. As fragile as it was, the normative state followed its own principles and operated as a different paradigm. During the following decades, the system has struggled to develop its regularity, normality, and integrity. While it may have expanded and contracted as the prerogative state ebbs and flows, the normative state has its own inherent features. For all its deficiencies, the Chinese normative state is committed to legalism with accountability and judicial oversight, which has formed rule-based pockets with varying degrees of commitment. As discussed in this article, the Party has both tolerated and encouraged the creation of a legal space in which personal freedom and individual rights in ordinary criminal matters have been gradually, decisively, and legally carved out for enhanced legal and judicial protection. This leaves a range of political matters, including national security cases, anticorruption enforcement, and cases that are pertinent to collective action, that are all broadly defined to include politically sensitive activities that challenge the Party's monopoly of political power, which remains firmly in the hands of the prerogative state.
The reform initiatives in building a normative state, as discussed in the article, were not implemented in a political vacuum. They have taken place in a Leninist Party system alongside a prerogative state that is hostile to normative challenges. The Party will not tolerate any separation of powers and independent institutions, and the prerogative state will jealously guard and maintain its territory. As Chan emphasizes, the prerogative state is in control and shapes the structure of the dual state. It determines its competency and decides on the exception. The key feature of the dual state, as Fraenkel puts it, is that “there is nothing which cannot be classified as ‘political”’ and would not be subject to the prerogative state."
"MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LIABILITY IN CHINA (MAINLAND)

","The Tort Law of China, in 2009, reaffirmed that medical malpractice liability is a sort of fault-based tort liability. This law adopted an objective standard of fault, with provisions of presumption of fault under certain circumstances. The new law also overthrew the regulation of the Supreme People's Court which required the defendant to prove the lack of causation. In malpractice of medical products and blood transfusion, the physician will assume non-fault liability.
In mainland China jurisdiction, the history of medical malpractice liability can only be traced back to the 1990s. To deal with the increased number of medical malpractice cases, the courts applied the fault-based tort liability, stipulated by the Art. 106 of the General Principles of Civil Law of 1986. In 2009, the Chinses legislator stipulated the Tort Liability Law, of which the Chap. 7 (Art. 54 to Art. 64) is Medical Malpractice Liability. After more than ten years of practice, the Tort Liability Law was codified as the Book VII of the Chinese Civil Code, passed by the 3rd session of the 13th National People's Congress on May 28th, 2020, with minor modifications. This chapter aims to outline the medical liability in the context of the new Civil Code.",Legal analysis,,
"FORMALITY, FREEDOM OF CONTRACT AND CHINA'S NEW CIVIL CODE: A LEGAL REFORM RECOMMENDATION FOR LAND SALE CONTRACTS

","In China, the freedom of contract principle includes the freedom of contractual formality that entitles claimants to choose formality in contractual matters. Accordingly, where the law mandates written form, claimants arguably lose the freedom to use other types of formality, and this is seen to contradict the freedom of contract principle.
However, this Article argues that the statutory requirement of writing does not contradict but instead safeguards freedom of contract, because writing introduces desirable attributes to protect claimants from the risks that currently exist in China's judicial system. Further, the freedom of contractual formality is well applied in China, as China's new Civil Code (enacted by its supreme legislature) respects this freedom. The Code establishes the general informality rule to allow claimants to choose formality. The Code employs a more advanced approach to recognize digital forms and increases formality freedom in e-commerce. The Code allows claimants to make pre-contractual statements and terminate contracts in any form. The Code also gives claimants the freedom to set writing as a condition for contract formation, makes notarization optional, and maximizes the possibility of upholding contracts despite mandating the requirement of writing.
This Article further proposes a legal reform recommendation that the Civil Code should mandate writing for land sale contracts. This reform could effectively eradicate the nationwide uncertainty in land contract cases, thereby protecting claimants from the *333 uncertainty and safeguarding contractual freedom, particularly given the importance of contractual remedies in land cases. This would create a fairer legal environment to advance the judicial reform that is set by China's supreme power.
This research is timely and valuable. The Code took effect recently so there is little literature about the Code or its application to formality freedom. Moreover, only the Code (the most authoritative statute in Chinese civil law matters) can and has provided all claimants across China with the ability to enjoy the freedom fully and completely.",Legal analysis,,"In China, the freedom of contract principle includes the freedom of contractual formality that entitles claimants to choose their preferred types of formality. Hence, when a written form is mandated by law, this arguably restricts the freedom of contract and the freedom of contractual formality.
This article has argued that the freedom of contractual formality is well respected in China, and the statutory requirement of written form does not contradict the freedom of contract principle. Written form is an important means to safeguard the freedom of contract because it introduces desirable attributes to protect claimants from the nationwide uncertainty in land sale contract cases and evidentiary risks in the judicial system.
In particular, China's new Civil Code respects the freedom of contractual formality. The Civil Code establishes the general informality rule, further relaxes the digital form to boost ecommerce, restricts the application of the statutory writing requirement at different contractual stages, and gives claimants the freedom to set a written form as a condition for contract formation when it is not mandated. Additionally, the Civil Code allows claimants to choose between writing and notarization, thus maximizing the possibility of upholding contracts.
This Article has also proposed a legal reform recommendation that the Civil Code should mandate written form for land sale contracts. This reform would protect claimants from the identified uncertainty and risks in land sale contract cases and thereby safeguard contractual freedom. This reform and protection are particularly necessary given the importance of contractual remedies in land cases.
This research is timely and valuable, partly because the Civil Code took effect recently, and partly because only the Civil Code-- the most authoritative statute in civil law matters that is enacted by the supreme legislature--can guarantee that all claimants across China fully enjoy the freedom of contractual formality."
"THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER RULES OF THE US-CHINA PHASE ONE TRADE AGREEMENT: COMPETITION OF GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP

","Over the past four decades, Intellectual Property (IP) has been one of the main controversies of US-China trade relations. But the current US-China trade war contains a new focus - technology transfer. This article adopts a socio-legal and economic approach to examine the current technology and trade tensions between these two countries and why China became an Information Technology (IT) powerhouse. It first provides an overview of IP and technology transfer rules under the Phase One US-China Economic and Trade Agreement (POA). It then explores different forms of forced technology transfer activities and the in-depth reasons for the US to shift its main IP concerns from IP enforcement to technology transfer. It explains why the US and China trade war is inevitable, why the current US-China IP-trade war is significantly different from previous ones, and the economic and political reasons behind the global technology leadership competition by the two countries. Finally, the author concludes that the POA and its technology transfer rules are not the ends of the game but just the start of the global technology leadership competition between the US and China.",Legal analysis,,"This article examined the political economy behind the technology transfer rules of the POA. It explored different forms of forced technology transfer activities and discussed the in-depth reasons behind the current technology and trade tensions between the US and China. It then explained why the US and China trade war is unavoidable and what economic and political reasons for the global technology leadership competition by the two countries are.
Based on the above analysis, this article concludes that the technology and trade tensions between the US and China cannot be simply resolved by any unilateral approach or POA-like unbalanced, bilateral agreements. Implementing technology transfer rules has become an essential part of the current competition of global technology leadership between the US and China. Such a competition would not be affected or weakened by the change of the US Government Administration from President Trump to President Biden.185 Similarly, China would not slow down its pace to become an IT powerhouse or miss any opportunities to catch up with the US in high technology markets.
The POA and its technology transfer rules are not the ends of the game but just the start of the global technology leadership competition between the US and China. Therefore, before seeking practical legal solutions for implementing technology transfer rules, it is imperative for future regulators from the US and China to understand both political and economic dimensions behind the current trade and technology tensions between these two countries."
"TORTIOUS LIABILITY IN CHINA'S MOTORSPORTS INDUSTRY

","In 2020, the Chinese Civil Code came into effect. Article 1176 of the code offers a statutory defense for those participating in “a recreational or sports activity carrying certain risk” when they cause injury to other participants. However, the Chinese Civil Code does not specify how or to what extent Article 1176 may be relied upon as a statutory defense in assessing the tortious liability of the organizers of such recreational or sports activities. The courts in China have long sought to develop a principled approach to applying the voluntary assumption of risk defense to such organizers. This Article provides a case study to examine how Article 1176 operates in the context of motor racing activities, identifying sources of uncertainty surrounding the application of the law. By reviewing how Australian law analyses the duty and liability of event organizers, this Article also identifies the strengths of the Australian approach and how it may inform Chinese law with respect to addressing the problems associated with Article 1176. ",Legal analysis,,"Article 1176 of the Chinese Civil Code must be refined to address uncertainties regarding the assessment of organizers' liability in the context of dangerous sports activities. This Article indicates how such reform could proceed, such as by clarifying the key term “risk” as referring to the inherent risks associated with such activities. Even more importantly, the revised Article 1176 provision should clarify how the special context of activities “carrying certain risk” will affect the operation of the defense that Article 1176 provides. As proposed above, in applying Article 1176, the courts must distinguish the VAR defense under Article 1176 from the general VAR defense, due to Article 1176's focus on a specific context. The legislative intent of Article 1176 admits the possibility of allowing sports organizers to invoke Article 1176 as a complete defense for liability arising from sports accidents. Further, Australia's DRA and VAR defenses could be particularly helpful in specifying the conditions under which the VAR defense is to be invoked for the purpose of revising the statute.
Moreover, this Article posits that the provision of adequate medical support and effective rescue should be deemed part of the duty of safety protection imposed on organizers, as harm is highly likely to occur when engaging in these types of dangerous activities. Legislators should consider specifying certain irreducible core elements of the duty of safety protection. Article 1176's provisions overlap with the enforcement of organizers' duty of safety protection in numerous respects, rendering it difficult to achieve a principled approach to applying the article without a clear definition of the phrase “duty of safety protection.” *85 Legislators and courts should balance the interests of organizers and participants when determining their respective obligations and liabilities. Establishing irreducible elements would avoid the imposition of disproportionate duties and the unfair assignment of losses flowing from the materialization of risks inherently associated with the activities themselves."
"ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND PRISON RENOVATION IN REFORM CHINA

","This article discusses the embeddedness of penal control in communist China against a broader economic structure beginning with the era of economic reform in the late 1970s till the Chinese government's decision to renovate the prison system thoroughly in 2003. It focuses readers on the institutional changes of the prison system in response to the macroeconomic changes during this period when the planned economy was transformed into a market economy. While the traditional mode of prison-enterprise combination had a period of prosperity when the economic transition was in its early stage in the 1980s, as the new economic system developed, the inherent weakness of the prison-enterprise combination and the conflicting organizational settings made the prison system incapable of competing with other business units, causing it to suffer economic difficulties since the late 1980s. In response, the Chinese government decided to terminate the combination mode and singled out the enterprise side from the prison system in 2003. These institutional changes in the prison design have unraveled the sensitivity of the traditional mode of prison-enterprise combination to the economic changes and unfolded the flexible nature of the prison-labor complex in communist China.",Legal analysis,,"As the Cultural Revolution came to an end and the era of economic reform rose in the second half of the 1970s, the tremendous shifts in the Chinese society also brought about the transformation of the prison system, particularly its economic role as a special state-owned enterprise in the macroeconomic settings. In the reform era, punitiveness was losing its importance and prisoner's labor was rather catching more attention, and this change possibly resulted from that the economic performance outweighed other concerns in the reform era. Consequently, the principle of less eligibility played an important role in the prison practice in the pre-reform era, but it has been no longer emphasized when the reform era began. As the general economic structure was redirected from the traditional planned economy to the contract-responsibility system in the late 1970s and early 1980s, prison production thus modulated itself into the same direction to address the huge loss and collapse caused by the Cultural Revolution.
Prison in the style of people's commune in the pre-reform era and prison in the style of contract-responsibility in the reform era had different fates, even though they shared the same feature of prison-enterprise combination and were both required to be self-sufficient. The former, existing in the period of planned economy, didn't encounter the challenge from the market because all business activities, including supply, transportation, marketing, and sales, were under the control of the state, and all the prisons had to do was to mobilize prisoners to produce. On the contrary, the latter had a complicated role for it afforded several business activities since the economic reform was boosted. During the first a few years after adopting the contract-responsibility system, prison enterprise did acquire some profits, but as the new economic system kept moving farther, the inherent weakness of prison enterprise in a combined form and the mutually conflicting organizational settings made itself incapable of competing with other business units, and thus it began to suffer the economic difficulties since the late 1980s.
Moreover, in the pre-reform era, the focus of prison enterprise was put on the amount of production and the other parts of the entire prison system were rather left unattended. Nevertheless, when coming into the reform age, the problems of the financial structure, prisoners' living conditions and education, and the training of prison cadres were all uncovered and came into the picture. As the state was lowering its appearance in the economic system during the process of economic reform and adjusting its control methods over the market into a more intricate manner, the program of forced job placement thus lost its economic importance and finally came to an end in 1989. Two more nuanced measures for the management of released population, “settling down” and “reeducation assistance,” were applied and gradually adapted to the marketized economic framework.
Eventually, the deep-rooted inadaptability of prison-enterprise combination to the market economy led to the prison renovation in 2003, and the separation of prison and enterprise became the task of top priority. When in the time of prison-enterprise combination, the most common organizational setting in the practice was “same staff under two titles,” where every member of prison cadres and prison officials was assigned various duties based on their duo roles in prisoner reform and prison production, and their benefits were directly connected with the profits of prison enterprise. This organizational setting performed well in the period of planned economy but was stumbling along in the reform period and eventually was replaced by the separation mode. It remains to be seen influence of this change on the entire prison system and the society, but it reveals the sensitivity of the Chinese prison system to the economic changes and presents the flexible nature of the prison-labor complex in communist China."
"FOCUS ON CHINA: THE EXPANSIVE USE OF NATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS CONCERNS

",,Legal analysis,,"The labelling of a large number of trade-related issues concerning China as national security concerns may often be desirable and advantageous to the U.S. Administration and other U.S. policymakers from a political perspective. As discussed above, this allows the United States to utilize national security tools, which have fewer legal constraints in executive power. Moreover, labeling all actions by China as national security threats is an easy way to garner public support through playing the nationalism card.
In reality, using such instruments haphazardly, without the proper legal and factual basis, has resulted in costs that outweigh the benefits. Indeed, as discussed above, the adverse effects of such blunt, sudden instruments have resulted in unintended adverse effects on U.S. companies, U.S. jobs, and the U.S. economy overall. Therefore, rather than taking the overly simplistic approach that outcompeting China and addressing national security threats posed by China are synonymous, the U.S. government should clearly articulate and critically examine the nature of the underlying policy issue. What is truly the “national security” issue in a particular context? What is the nature of the national security threat, if any? And is the national security measure being contemplated appropriately tailored to addressing the very concern at issue?
In sum, “national security” should not become a way to avoid such critical analysis. It provides important tools that should be wielded carefully so as to avoid overreach, and to ensure credibility when the tools are actually needed. There is critical value with respect to this last point. Not only does careful use of national security instruments by the United States model the primacy of the rule of law in the global context, it discourages other countries from claiming national or defensive security when there is no such concern, and it helps the United States to maintain the moral high ground in its role as a leader of the world trading community.
Domestically, enacting trade policy and employing trade measures, and clearly distinguishing such actions from more clearly defined terms “national security,” will only create greater predictability, stability, and transparency for the U.S. economy, whereby all will benefit. With respect to how the United States deal with China, clearly delineating between economic competitive concerns and legitimate national security concerns will mitigate adverse consequences associated with conflating the two problems and will not allow the two countries to compartmentalize these issues such that problems can be isolated and dealt with in the appropriate time without fully decoupling the bilateral relationship. Indeed, the Biden Administration has recently signaled that it recognizes the importance of engaging with China as a competitor and peer, as well as the negative consequences of failing to do so. 
With respect to how best to deal with the economic competitiveness issues, it is our view that the best defense is a good offense. In other words, the United States must practice what it preaches by competing on a level playing field based on market forces, rather than seek to artificially “contain” or suppress China's rise. And rather than approaching U.S.-China relations from the sole standpoint of a broad, imprecise concept of “national security,” resulting only in the adoption of defensive trade measures intended originally only to diffuse such threats, the United States must acknowledge the complexity of the bilateral relationship, recognize that China is a legitimate economic competitor that needs to be kept accountable, and then utilize legitimate tools to ensure a level playing field and a strong market competitiveness environment to benefit U.S. companies, U.S. consumers, and U.S. interests in the long term."
"FITTING CHINA--US TRADE INTO WTO TRADE LAW--NATIONAL SECURITY AND NON-VIOLATION MECHANISMS

","Part I of this Article briefly describes the post-2016 deterioration of the China-U.S. trade relationship and the emergence of an increasing consensus in the United States that geo-political considerations must have primacy over economic issues in the United States' interactions with China. Part II of this Article presents GATT Article XXI then lays out eight hypothetical U.S. trade restrictions against China ranging from a continuation and refinement of the current steel and aluminum tariffs to a sweeping revision of U.S. trade terms to address climate change. The question is: are any of these hypothetical actions defensible under GATT Article XXI? To explore that question, Part III reviews in detail the WTO Russia - Traffic in Transit (2019) decision, the first full-blown GATT/WTO panel analysis of the provision. Part IV then reviews seventy years of state practice and pronouncements on Article XXI. Although the Russia - Traffic in Transit (2019) panel found that state practice did not reveal any “agreement between the Members regarding the interpretation of Article XXI,” these decades of claims, discussion, and debates about Article XXI are nonetheless informative for our consideration of the hypotheticals.31 Lastly, Part V explores a GATT “non-violation” claim as a Chinese countermeasure to a U.S. Article XXI claim and how mutual suspension of China-U.S. GATT obligations might be pursued in the WTO system.",Legal analysis,,"After $5.5 trillion in accumulated trade debt, the United States has finally accepted that trade with China's mercantilist economy cannot continue as it did from 2000 through 2017; this is part of the new, overall consensus in Washington that in the near future China and the United States will be in what President Biden called “extreme competition.” It is almost axiomatic to that consensus that China-U.S. trade relations can no longer be fitted within the standard operation of the WTO system.
Is there any way that sui generis China-U.S. terms of trade can be made to fit into the multilateral rules of the WTO system? One answer would be for the WTO membership to grant China and the United States a “waiver” from their trade obligations to one another. As of 2021, there would be no reason for China to accept that outcome and little reason to think the United States could convince the WTO membership to support a waiver in the face of China's opposition. Another approach under the WTO rules would be justifying a wide range of U.S. trade restrictions on either the national security exceptions of GATT Article XXI or the “non-violation” mechanism of GATT Article XXIII. A comprehensive Article XXIII “non-violation” claim is beyond the scope of this Article; wise or unwise, it would be a massive undertaking for the United States' trade dispute resources.
As an interim measure, the United States should think of trade restrictions vis-à-vis China in terms of national security and be prepared to defend such restrictions on grounds of the GATT “security exceptions” provision, Article XXI. Even after the first WTO panel decision interpreting GATT Article XXI in 2019, the national security exceptions under GATT and the other WTO Agreements remain largely unexplored territory. Contrary to what many commentators and pundits have said, there are ample examples in GATT/WTO history that provide some parallels to the U.S. claiming national security grounds for careful, calibrated restrictions on imports of steel, aluminum, composite materials, rare earth metals, pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductor chips, and PPE. There are also ample examples in GATT/WTO history of “overall relationship” disputes that have prevented countries from having trade relationships consistent with GATT/WTO disciplines.
All of these historical examples should be brought to bear on the China-U.S. trade relationship. If the United States were to prevail in a national security exception claim, China itself could have recourse to ‘re-balance’ its own tariff concessions to the United States under GATT Article XXIII(b). In short, this could be a means of engaging WTO mechanisms to normalize some trade disengagement between the two economies."
"ASSESSING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR POTENTIAL U.S. CONFLICT WITH CHINA OVER TAIWAN

","The main objective of this article is to assess the existing legal framework for potential U.S. conflict with China. Part II will provide background on PRC and U.S. policies, capabilities, and commitments as they relate to Taiwan. Part III will address the general authorities concerning the use of force, briefly addressing justifications to use force under international law before turning to assess current U.S. domestic authorities, including those deriving from the Constitution and statutory authorities. Part IV will then address whether there are any limitations on exercising those authorities in light of the existing legal framework. It will do this by applying the framework to some hypothetical scenarios. In Part V the article will evaluate whether additional authorities may be needed to confront China and, if so, what those additional necessary authorities are. This evaluation will include a review of some current proposals in Congress at the time of this writing.
Importantly, this article does not advocate what the United States should do if China were to invade Taiwan or use any force against the United States or its allied or partner forces. Rather, it discusses what the United States may do militarily based on the current understanding of the existing legal framework absent additional authorities from Congress. Of note, there may be a range of non-military options available to respond to any attack on Taiwan, many of which may be preferable to a United States use of force against China.",Legal analysis,,"The PRC is rapidly increasing its military and economic power, presenting itself as the most significant strategic competitor to the United States today. President Xi has set a newly aggressive tone in the PRC's relations around the world and specifically with regard to Taiwan. The PLA will soon possess the capability to launch a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan and already presents a challenge to the United States in the Indo-Pacific. The prospects of a conflict over Taiwan increase as the PRC continues to strengthen its military and economy. The United States must be prepared to act quickly and decisively in order to protect its interests in the region. Understanding the President's authority to order the use of military force in support of U.S. interests, including the defense of Taiwan, is crucial to ensuring the Government is prepared to act quickly. While the President may possess the authority to act when required, a whole of Government approach that involves all instruments of national power, engages both the executive and legislative branches to demonstrate unity of purpose and broad support, and leverages our allies and partners in the region presents the United States and Taiwan with the best chance of success in defeating PRC aggression."
WORKFORCE EQUALITY: THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTION OF EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY IN MAO-ERA CHINA,"In order to answer the question of how educational equality was conceived and practiced in the constitutional gaze of Mao-era China, this Article presents its history in three parts. The first part explores where the Maoist concept of educational equality came from, that is, the constitutional goal that drove the idea of equality-as-empowerment. Upon the founding of the People's Republic, the Communist Party of China (CCP) established the goal of industrialization, divided into socialist revolution and socialist reconstruction, with which the equal education laws were in line. The second part examines how the Maoist egalitarianism in education worked, elaborating on the legal embodiment of equality-as-empowerment and the engagement of workforce equality with industrialization. The new regime included the disadvantaged in its educational programs through universal mass education, and imposed a combination of education and productive labor, thereby empowering them to become industrial laborers. The third part traces where the Maoist view of educational equality was going, namely the consequences and implications of the constitutional conception of workforce equality. Maoist equality of results led to an unprecedented supply of education and to a considerable gap between education and employment that the authorities sought to bridge, both of which had important impacts on market-oriented reforms in the post-Mao era.",Legal analysis,,"Winding up from a hundred years' social disturbance, political instability, and intellectual anarchy, post-war China was desperate to realize national independence and to get rid of poverty. Since the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China had, in trial and error, attempted to build an industrialized socialist state for three decades until the Constitution of 1982 declared a reform era. Facing challenges near and far, the nascent communist regime under Mao set rapid industrialization as its constitutional goal, which included both socialist reconstruction and socialist revolution. Mao-era China's transition from an agricultural to an industrial country required a large supply of workers at a time when illiteracy rates were extremely high. Providing equal education to those who had been denied access to education in order to make them qualified industrial workers, therefore, became the very point of achieving rapid industrialization. It is in this sense that equality in education took on an empowering connotation in the constitutional vision. It means that the historical actors who were crucial in shaping constitutional conceptualizations held a workforce-oriented idea of equality of results, which sought to empower the masses to become an equal, if not homogenous, workforce through education.
That conception of empowerment-as-equality was evidently revealed in the educational revolution of the Maoist regime, particularly in two education laws: One was universal education aimed at including all in education programs; the other was the combination of education and productive labor whereby students were transformed into laborers and workers were trained to become a competent socialist workforce. Through various education programs, the authorities included the masses of workers and peasants in the socialist education program, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed for socialist reconstruction and the socialist consciousness required for the socialist revolution. Moreover, calling on combining education with productive labor, the regime endeavored to conduct literacy education and technical training to the working-class and directly transform students into laborers working in factories and farms. As such, the Maoist equal education laws for the traditionally disadvantaged sought to empower the masses to become the desired workforce for pursuing industrialization. The Maoist vision for educational equality was, in other words, empowerment. In the process of putting that concept of equality-as-empowerment into practice, intellectuals and other mental laborers were trained as industrial or agricultural workers, thus achieving the constitutional vision of workforce equality.
The Maoist concept of educational equality was successful in fueling industrialization, yet in a sense, it also sowed the seeds of its own demise. Under the goal of industrialization, the economic disparities between industry and agriculture and between urban and rural areas would inevitably exist, if not widen. During the Mao era, the countryside was economically exploited by the cities. By the late 1970s, most peasants were probably economically worse off than they had been in the 1950s and even the 1930s. Similarly, Maoist educational equality laws served primarily to transform the masses into a more trained industrial workforce, leaving the countryside and peasantry somewhat neglected. Most of the vigorous rural egalitarian education programs were also of poor quality, ending in many cases at literacy. Moreover, the unprecedented large scale of education supply created a huge gap between education and employment. Laws and policies that attempted to bridge the gap were only palliative and did not address the root causes of the problem: the disparities between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants. Worse, some, such as the planned college specialties that were exclusively industry-related, the dual urban-rural household system that restricted migration,253 and the dual urban-rural family planning quota, even exacerbated the divisions and disparities. Despite the Constitutions' reiteration that “the alliance of workers and peasants is the basis of the dictatorship of proletariat,” it is clear that in the Mao era, when industrialization was the constitutional goal, industry and industrial workers were the main protagonists. The peasants and the rural sector, on the other hand, were de facto marginalized in the Maoist economic structure.
The rusticated youth were also an educationally and economically marginalized group. The Maoist regime sacrificed the opportunity for millions of young people to continue their education in exchange for relief from urban employment pressures. And when they finally managed to return to the cities, many of the youth found it still difficult to get hired in factories and even harder to get into universities. As a result, most of them became what the authorities called “to-be-employed youth” (daiye qingnian) and “socially idle laborers,” and hence marginalized by the planned economy of the late Mao era. It was, however, precisely in those two marginalized groups that the post-Mao reforms found their outlet. The desperate peasants who privately negotiated a family smallholding system led to the de-collectivization reform, which was the prelude to the market-oriented reforms. The mounting employment pressure and the risk of large-scale social unrest caused by the unemployed youth made the government “open the door to employment” and gradually liberalize the individual economy, which also became the vanguard of the market transformation. The Maoist equality-as-empowerment ideal, by overemphasizing industrial labor to the point of overlooking if not exacerbating the peasants' hardships, and by producing a population with an education that exceeded the available employment opportunities, ironically created the conditions for a new wave of reforms and a new constitutional conception of educational equality. It was the peasants and unemployed youth who were most deprived by the Maoist workforce egalitarianism that became the forerunners of post-Mao market-oriented reforms. It was in those marginalized groups that the seeds of reform quietly sprouted."
CHINA'S BRI ON THE POLAR SILK ROAD: EVOLVING LABOR AGENDA IN THE ARCTIC,"China is implementing its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) into the Arctic area that is yet fashioning its labor law norms and transitioning from a subsistence to a future commercial economy. This involves eight countries which have borders on the vast area of the Arctic Ocean, which with global warming are looking toward expanding commercial activities. Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greenland (Denmark), Russia, U.S., and Canada have come together to form the Arctic Council, which is the “leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States, Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular on issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic.” They often are referred to as the “Arctic 8” and there are also eight “permanent participants” with councils or associations from the various indigenous peoples' communities.
Within the Arctic Circle there are about four million inhabitants, half of which are Russians, and include indigenous peoples. The types of anticipated projects may include scientific stations, roads coming from the EU, ports, and port facilities, i.e., all the construction that comes with developmental building. With BRI projects, China usually employs many of its own citizens as workers as well as hiring locally, if available. Manpower and labor force issues often accompany BRI projects, and the questions raised include, what are the labor norms in the Arctic and what labor dispute mechanisms are available? Certainly, territorial labor laws control, but there are special needs and rules in the Arctic Circle, and some of the “Arctic 8” are European Union members who have special rules on posted workers from the EU and the Chinese may have private international arbitration agreements covering workers.
Some BRI projects are moving forward in Norway and Finland and other EU Member States even without BRI MOU agreements. Currently, only Russia has embraced BRI cooperation and is moving ahead on projects. The U.S. has been active in attempting to persuade some Arctic 8 countries to not enter BRI projects or MOU cooperation agreements, for professed security concerns.
Finally, discussion will include the role of private versus government regulatory standards and dispute resolution, as well as potential cooperation or trade agreements that could include labor protection provisions. Currently, Iceland has an FTA with China, though the labor provisions are weak. Also, Russia, as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), signed an FTA with China in 2018; the EAEU is a trade bloc (often cited as Russia's answer to the EU), currently including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.
The article will identify the types of labor issues that could arise as China's BRI moves up the Polar Silk Road and discuss possible regulatory approaches.",Legal analysis,,"The emergence of the significance of the Arctic Circle is certainly one of the “new frontiers.” Understanding it and its geopolitical and economic importance will only grow, along with global warming. Planning for the impacts on local labor forces and communities, workers (native, local, and foreign), and their rights and protection clearly must be dealt with as developers of land and the Arctic Sea are beginning to enter the domain."
THE U.S.-CHINA FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER DISPUTE,"Because the subject of forced technology transfer has been, until recently, underexplored in legal literature--and, for that matter, in scholarly literature in other fields--this Article utilizes the forum provided by this Symposium to weigh in on the debate. To enhance its analytical focus, the Article closely examines the U.S.-China forced technology transfer dispute, including the WTO complaint that the United States filed against China in March 2018. It is this Author's hope that a better understanding of this topic will illuminate the debate on intellectual property protection and enforcement in China. Insights gleaned from this topic will also inform similar disputes within the WTO as well as other U.S.-China trade disputes in the intellectual property and technology areas.
Part II examines the WTO dispute between China and the United States over the issue of forced technology transfer. It offers a critical assessment of the complaint filed by the United States, which alleged violations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS Agreement”). To provide context for this dispute, Parts III and IV explore the longstanding North-South technology transfer debate and the more recent debate on the involuntary disclosure of trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information to combat COVID-19. By providing contextual reflections, these two Parts highlight the challenges and complexities in the U.S.-China forced technology transfer dispute. Part V concludes by offering suggestions on how China and the United States can move forward constructively from this ongoing dispute.",Legal analysis,,"The debate on international transfer of technology has been around for decades. Because the WTO and its TRIPS Agreement have not resolved this debate, the issues will not go away any time soon. To some extent, one could view the U.S.-China forced technology transfer dispute as one of the debate's latest iterations. If the difficulties surrounding the international debate is any guide, resolving the U.S.-China dispute will not be quick and easy. With the ongoing rivalry between China and the United States in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analytics, and biomedicine, the dispute will only intensify, making the debate even more contentious.
By juxtaposing the U.S.-China forced technology transfer dispute with the North-South technology transfer debate and the ongoing opposition to the COVID-19 TRIPS waiver, this Article has shown that the debate on international transfer of technology has been more complex and less binary than policymakers and commentators have assumed or are willing to admit. Policymakers and commentators should therefore devote greater energy, effort, and resources to study the challenges and complexities involved. The sooner they do so, the quicker they will be able to come up with new or better solutions, and the more successful they will be in minimizing tensions and conflicts between China and the United States."
ORDER AND LAW IN CHINA,"This Article proposes a reunderstanding of what is conventionally called China's legal system. It argues that a number of observations about its institutions are not plausibly explained using the conventional vocabulary and concepts of legality. When we see inconsistencies, we tend to explain them as signs of the immaturity of the legal system, or as mistakes, or as unrepresentative aberrations. This kind of explanation is driven by a conscious or subconscious convergence theory.
But we have to take these inconsistencies seriously and come up with a theory does not require us to treat them as inconsistencies; a theory that treats them as features, not bugs. This Article argues that China has been building a system for the maintenance of order and the political primacy of the Chinese Communist Party (“CCP”), not for the delivery of justice. It urges that we should not make ethnocentric assumptions about how various institutions in China--or indeed in any society with which we are not familiar--do or should operate merely on the basis of similarity of (translated) name or apparent isomorphism. If too many observations don't fit the model, then it's time to change the model, not to dismiss the observations.
The argument presented here--that we should look beyond the “rule of law” model as the sole way of analyzing and measuring a society's order maintenance institutions--has implications for our understanding of authoritarian governance beyond just China. It is customary to locate authoritarian, non-democratic states at a midpoint on a spectrum with no rule of law at one end and perfect rule of law at the other, the midpoint being labeled “rule by law.” But “rule by law” turns out to be a thin and unsatisfactory concept. Applying this label amounts to saying not much more than that the institutions in question don't measure up to the rule-of-law standard. We must learn to look for the apparent outliers, the errors and imperfections, and to ask ourselves whether they can be incorporated into a different paradigm that treats them as normal and expected. We might well find that the variety of human institutions is far richer than we had imagined.",Legal analysis,,"This Article has argued that Chinese institutions conventionally described using the vocabulary of law are better understood through a different theoretical lens: that of order maintenance more broadly, or stability maintenance (in the specific Chinese sense of the term) more narrowly. Viewed through that lens, phenomena that appear anomalous when interpreted through a legal lens--for example, the lack of legal education of a Supreme People's Court president, or a court president serving simultaneously as a top police official--appear normal and expected. His lack of legal training becomes as remarkable in that position as his lack of musical or athletic training.
If this understanding is correct--or perhaps I should say, “if useful or persuasive,” since paradigms are not judged by their objective correctness--it constitutes a counter-narrative to the story of steady legal institution-building in the post-Mao era. It suggests that underneath the apparent reforms, there are significant continuities. The analysis rests not on ephemeral snapshots of the eternal cycling of fang (<<foreign language>>) and shou (<<foreign language>>)--liberalization and repression--but rather on features of Chinese order maintenance institutions that have existed for decades. And it should not be surprising that such features exist and are important; order maintenance institutions are closely tied into the overall political system, and the overall political system displays important and enduring features--to take an obvious example, the pervasive hegemony of the CCP--that have not changed since 1949.
To be sure, China has seen vast changes, both from 1949 and from 1979. The argument presented here does not deny these changes but suggests interpreting them through a different lens. To measure them on a rule-of-law axis implies a goal that has never been there. What China has been building for the last forty years are order maintenance institutions.
The analysis presented here has implications for our understanding of authoritarian governance beyond just China. It is still customary to view authoritarian, non-democratic states as being on a spectrum from no rule of law at one end, perfect rule of law at the other, and “rule by law” in the middle. And to the extent they are reasonably stable and have institutions that look like familiar legal institutions, “rule by law” is how they tend to be characterized.
But “rule by law” turns out to be a thin and unsatisfactory concept: as Cheesman remarks, it is nothing more than a “poor man's rule of law.” Applying this label amounts to saying not much more than that the institutions in question don't measure up to the rule-of-law standard. That all may be accurate. But surely China cannot be the only jurisdiction for which alternative paradigms might be more helpful. We must learn to look for the apparent outliers, the errors and imperfections, and to ask ourselves whether they can be incorporated into a paradigm that treats them as normal and expected. We might well find that the variety of human institutions is far richer than we had imagined."
CHINA'S FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW: MOVING TOWARD GREATER LIBERALIZATION?,,Legal analysis,,"Investment liberalization aims to create a mutually beneficial situation under the contemporary background of international labor division. Foreign investors optimize global resources for productivity and benefits while host countries develop their economies through FDI spillovers like advanced technology transfers or innovation management practices and operating processes. For the past few years, with a declining populace and a slow-developing economy, China has focused on creating a more liberal investment environment to remain competitive in terms of FDI attraction. China's FIL advances its historic mission of reform and opening-up. The new law ends the chaos of the Three Laws, granting complete national treatment for FDI and simplifying investing and business activities in China. China has ceased resisting FDI and has begun to grant additional procedural and substantive rights to investors. Instead of the growing investment protectionism of many developed countries, China is shifting its FDI policy to protect investors' interests and rights. This shift corresponds with China's conversion of investment status from primary recipient to primary FDI provider.
Investment liberalization is an important international initiative to promote global investment, and its presence can indicate the FDI's appeal. Liberalization works to open up the domestic market and standardize national treatment while facilitation is mainly concerned with institutional and procedural issues in investment administration. If liberalization is a measure of whether a country has opened its doors sufficiently, then facilitation concerns ensuring the open doors remain open. The FIL has made significant progress in liberalization and facilitation. Nevertheless, multiple arguments and analyses have revealed that China's attitude concerning facilitation has been more amenable when compared with “opening the door.” In contrast to China's liberalization policies, the laws and regulations concerning facilitation are more comprehensive and practical. The main reason is that positive action is easier than negative inaction for the Chinese government. It is much easier for the Chinese government to guarantee and implement areas it has promised to open up than to re-expand new ones. If China fully opens its doors and realizes national treatment, enormous FDI inflow will hit domestic enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises that control vital industries. Complete investment liberalization is also a considerable test for China's labor market, financial market, and soft powers like IPRs. China is not sufficiently prepared yet.
With the number of open areas continuously increasing, issues of national security and supervision are trailing during the post-establishment period. Although the FIL mentions the national security review system to prevent risks caused by large FDI inflows, its corresponding application conditions, such as “special circumstances” and “for the public interest,” lack specific explanation. As the state exercises economic sovereignty when applying national security law, the law's provisions take on a stronger administrative role/character. China must elaborate vague provisions based on the FIL principles to transition from uncertain and unjust administrative enforcement to explicit and impartial judicial settlement.
China still has a long way to go in reforming the current FIL and its Implementing Regulation to make them less superficial, changeable, and unforeseeable, and instead more precise, stable, and predictable. The FIL has not solved the shackled dilemma that the Three Laws encountered for a long time fundamentally. The Chinese government has indeed made great progress in pushing forward investment liberalization and facilitation by enacting the FIL. In recent years, China has been the leader among the main FDI inflow and outflow countries domestic business environment improvement. China's facilitation improvement will undoubtedly enhance its ultimate investment liberalization. However, the essential reform issue is how China can liberalize and facilitate FDI inflow and operation by reducing unjust governmental intervention through strict legislation and enforcement, and develop a transparent, fair, consistent, and efficient administrative mechanism."
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON CHOICE OF LAW IN CHINA: A HOME RUN?,"In summary, this article endeavors to answer three important questions regarding the current choice-of-law regime in China:
1. To what extent is there a “homeward trend” in the application of law by Chinese courts in foreign-related cases?
2. If the “homeward trend” does exist to an extent, what factors have contributed to its formation?
3. With these factors in mind, what should be done with the current choice-of-law regime in China?
These questions will be examined with reference to empirical research conducted on 15,755 contract cases, all with foreign elements, decided by Chinese courts in the 12-year period between 2007 and 2018. This article will proceed as follows: Part II provides a brief introduction to the past and current choice of law regimes, divided by the passing of the Choice of Law Act. In particular, the section outlines the background, goals, and contractual choice of law rules of the Act. Part III sets out the methodology of the empirical research. Part IV details the various findings of the research, particularly the extent of the “homeward trend,” and the possible reasons for that trend, backed up by data derived from the research. Part V assesses the problems and merits of the current choice of law regime in China and the direction of reform, if any, that China will make. Part VI concludes the article.",Dataset analysis,,"Eighty years ago, Nussbaum said that the homeward trend was “a basic issue which deserves careful consideration by the practitioner as well as by the student of law.” This study is an endeavor to look into this fundamental research question in our discipline. Through reviewing more than 15,000 Chinese cases, it is hoped that it will not only shed new light on the homeward trend but also review the choice-of-law system in China. For conflict scholars, a thankless task such as this is a necessary prerequisite to articulating normative rules in the future. A phenomenon as pronounced as China's homeward trend reflects many issues within the system that will help foster development in our field.
A homeward trend on the Chinese scale is unprecedented in modern conflict of laws given the economic flows between China and the rest of the world. As much as it is caused by an uncertain law, giving unfettered discretion to Chinese judges to apply lex fori, the rather uniform exercise of judges' discretion, and the willing submission of parties to Chinese law all point to there being some level of attraction to the application of Chinese law. The empirical findings of this study therefore not only prove the existence of the homeward trend but also identify the positive factors that can be attributed to it, such as cost-efficient litigation in China. These same positive factors also challenge the conventional wisdom that the only course to take is the wholesale reform of the choice-of-law system. Instead, a new alternative suggested here is to keep the system generally intact but to amend it to reflect current judicial practice. That could be in the interests of all parties. Although the current choice-of-law system may be theoretically unpopular with idealists, it fits with the Chinese legal system at large, and may not be as detrimental to parties' interests as one may think. The data presented here cannot tell us the best course to take. However, the key conclusion is that China should not stay idle. It must align judicial practice and the law one way or the other. Either direction will promote both certainty and equity in the system."
